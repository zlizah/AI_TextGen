Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  You all, rest yourselves.  I understand you’ve been very busy.

Well, good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to be here today for this Veterans Initiative Summit.  I want to start, obviously, by thanking Steve Schwarzman for that wonderful introduction, for his passionate words.  I’ll be saying more about Steve in a few minutes, but for now, I think it’s appropriate if we give him a round of applause for his extraordinary leadership on behalf of our veterans and military families.  (Applause.)  

And of course, I want to thank all of you –- leaders from The Carlyle Group, KKR, TPG Capital, and the 150 companies across America.  Thank you all for joining forces to hire and advance our veterans in your businesses.

Now, as you may know, this issue has been one of our top priorities since the day we first launched Joining Forces back in 2011.  Back then, the unemployment rate for 9/11 veterans was more than 12 percent.  And for the youngest of these veterans, it was even worse -– one in three who wanted a job in this country couldn’t find one.

So we knew we had a crisis on our hands.  And that’s why, soon after Joining Forces was up and running, my husband issued a challenge to the private sector.  He challenged that sector to hire 100,000 veterans in little over a year.

Now, at the time, we thought this was a pretty ambitious goal, and to be honest, we were a little worried about whether we could meet it.  So our team, we started hustling.  We reached out to companies in every sector –- from construction and high tech to transportation and manufacturing.  We reached out to businesses of all sizes -– from tiny mom-and-pop operations to the Fortune 500.  And everywhere we went, we told employers about the talent, the character and the drive that define our veterans and their spouses.

And today, just four years later, American businesses have hired or trained not just 100,000 veterans and military spouses, not just 200,000 or 500,000 -- no, folks like you across this country have hired or trained more than 850,000 veterans and military spouses.  (Applause.)  And I think we can all agree that this is a breathtaking achievement.  And ultimately, it happened for one simple reason:  because employers realized that veterans are some of the most skilled, motivated, resilient employees they could find.

Our vets have invaluable experiences in everything from operations to logistics to IT.  They’ve overseen millions of dollars’ worth of assets.  They’ve supervised dozens, even hundreds of their peers.  And when it comes to dealing with stress or pressure, well, you can bring it, because these folks know a little bit about high-stakes situations.

And that’s why companies across this country now understand that hiring these men and women isn’t just the patriotic thing to do, it’s the right thing to do for their bottom line.  And the folks at Blackstone and other leaders here certainly understand this.  In fact, Blackstone, back in April of 2013, as Steve mentioned, they pledged to hire 50,000 veterans across their portfolio in five years.  And today, they are well ahead of schedule, hiring an average of 1,000 employees a month in all 50 states.

And in explaining why Blackstone made this commitment, Steve wrote -- and I’m going to quote him directly -- he said, “It’s clear that whatever the mission, these men and women are of the highest caliber and character.”  They have proven their value and their immense potential before they even walk in the door.  And I couldn’t agree more.

And I’d also like to point out that if anyone knows the importance of a good investment, it’s folks like Steve and the leaders of the other firms that are here today.  (Laughter.)    And when these firms make that kind of investment on behalf of their portfolio companies, that’s not just one commitment, it’s hundreds of commitments that can change hundreds of thousands of lives.

And that’s why, today, I am so thrilled that Blackstone and the rest of the leaders here have taken their commitment to the next level by opening up this summit to their competitors.  Can I say that again -- their competitors.  So to be clear, Blackstone and all of you here are so dedicated to supporting our veterans that you’re willing to help your competitors acquire the top talent in the country.  (Applause.)

I mean, private equity is one of the most competitive industries in this country; probably the closest thing you can come to hand-to-hand combat on a daily basis.  (Laughter.)  But Steve and Blackstone and all of you are doing this because you know that something bigger is at stake.  And you also know that while we’ve made important progress, we still have a lot of work to do on behalf of our veterans’ employment.

Now, it’s true that over the past four years, the unemployment rate for 9/11 veterans has dropped from the 12 percent in 2011 to 7.2 percent in 2014.  And since May of this year, it’s been around 5 percent.  That is a significant accomplishment, and it didn’t just happen by itself.  (Applause.)  It happened because folks like you stepped up, learned about what our vets and military spouses have to offer, and then you worked hard to set goals, and recruit and hire them.

And in the coming years, as Steve said, hundreds of thousands of more veterans and military spouses are going to be transitioning to civilian life.  So in many ways, our work here is really just beginning.

And let’s not forget that these men and women signed up to risk their lives for us.  They and their families served and sacrificed to keep all of us safe.  So if even one veteran who wants a job in this country is unemployed, as far as I’m concerned, that’s one too many.

So we need to keep on pushing forward on this issue.  We need to keep challenging ourselves not just to recruit and hire veterans, but also to retain and promote them –- to make sure they can move up the corporate ladder to the leadership positions they deserve.  And we need to ensure that our military spouses can have the careers they deserve too, even as they move across the country every two or three years and juggle all the stresses that come with military life. 

So I am thrilled that all of you are joining this effort.  And I want to thank you so much for everything you all have done and everything you will continue to do for our veterans and military families to give them the opportunities that they’ve earned.  You all should be incredibly proud of what you’re doing here.

And now, it is my pleasure to introduce your next panel, this distinguished group here.  (Applause.)  We have a group of veterans and a military spouse -- got to keep representing -- they are all rising stars at several of the companies in this room, and they’re going to tell you about their experience in the military and in the private sector.  And they’re going to offer some tips on how to recruit and promote other veterans just like them -- because they’re everywhere.  I meet them all the time.  You’re special, but you know there are others like you.  (Laughter.)  

I had a chance just briefly -- say hello to these individuals before we came onstage, and I know they are outstanding.  So I hope you all enjoy hearing from them as much as I enjoy watching their careers blossom.

And with that, I give you your next panel, which is entitled “Transitions and Integration Experiences.”

Thank you all so much, and God bless.  (Applause.)

Good morning, everyone.  To say I’m thrilled to be here is -- would be an understatement.  I look forward to this event every year, time that we honor our 2015 National Student Poets.  Don’t they look good?  (Laughter.)  They look good.  Bowties!  (Laughter.)  They did them themselves!  (Laughter and applause.)    

I want to start by recognizing a few important people who helped to make this day possible.  First of all, I want to recognize Rachel Goslins -- I know, you always say don’t even focus on me, but we can’t help it.  You’ve done such great work.  We love you.  You are phenomenal, and we couldn’t do this without you -- along with the President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities.  Would all the committee members here please just stand for a second so these students know who you are?  (Applause.)  This is the committee who makes everything we do here at the arts possible.  They lend their time, their expertise, their passion.  So you wouldn’t be here without these folks.  And they’ve been rock-solid for me for, oh, has it been seven years?  It’s been a while.  (Laughter.)  

I also want to recognize the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers, The Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, and, of course, our good, dear friend who’s back, Olivia Morgan, who has been the driving force behind this initiative right from the very beginning.  So you’re not -- you came here.  She’s in San Francisco, she left us.  But she’s back and still working hard.  Olivia, thank you.  Thank you for this.  Thank you for your passion.  Thank you for your work.

In just four years, all of you, this wonderful team of people, have developed a nationally renowned program for young poets.  In fact, this year’s contest received over 20,000 submissions.  That’s just wonderful -- 20,000.  This is a pretty competitive pool too, just so that you know.  You weren’t just given this.  (Laughter.)  You competed hard for these spots.  This is an incredible accomplishment, and I am so grateful to everyone for the outstanding work that makes this day possible.  

I also want to thank our distinguished poet, Jacqueline Woodson.  Jacqueline, where are you?  There you are, you’re right there.  We’re going to hear from her later.  

And it’s so important to have these mentors, these folks who have really built their careers here to be able to share and give advice.  So we’re grateful to you for your work, for your wisdom, for your talent, and for taking the time to be here.  So let’s give everyone -- (applause.)  

Forgive me, I have a cold that I’ve had for, like, 10 days now.  So pardon my congestion.  

But most of all, I want to honor the young people that are standing with me today, our fourth class of National Student Poets.  We have Chasity Hale, from Miami Beach, Florida.  We have Eileen Huang, from Holmdel, New Jersey.  We have De’John Hardges, from Cleveland, Ohio.  David Xiang, from Little Rock, Arkansas -- yes, yes, you guys make sure people know who you are.  (Laughter.)  And we’ve got Anna Lance, who is here all the way from Eagle River, Alaska.  She gets the prize for the furthest to travel.  (Laughter.)    

I’m so proud of you all, really.  I truly am.  And I had an opportunity to meet your families; we got a picture right before we did the pinning.  So I get the feeling that your families are pretty proud of you too today, right?  Let’s see the parents, the mentors who all -- please take a moment to stand so that we know who you are.  (Applause.)  Thank you all.  But here’s the thing.  I just don't want you all to be surprised if the next time they miss a chore or don't clean up after themselves that they might not hang this little White House visit over your head.  (Laughter.)  

But in all -- seriously, but today is about celebrating these extraordinary young people, but it’s also about bringing the power of poetry to kids across the country, which is why it's so important that we pull the media into this and we shine a big, bright light on this small but very talented group of young people.  That’s why the President and I launched this program.  

And as you may know, the President -- your President is crazy about poetry.  And we both wanted more of our young people to experience the joy and the freedom -- and also the fear that comes with writing poetry.  Right?  I mean, it's a scary proposition, because there’s some real fear that comes with exposing yourself in that way.  It’s scary to open yourself up and invite the entire world in to witness your deepest thoughts. 

I don't mean to scare you to death.  (Laughter.)  But it takes a level of bravery to be that vulnerable, to stand up in this room, this historic place, and lights and cameras, and share something so personal and so precious.  But that is also the beauty of poetry -- how it helps you take all those complex and confusing thoughts and emotions and put them into words.  

I experienced this myself when I was your age, because when I was younger I was a pretty passionate creative writer -- and I tried my hand at a little poetry, too.  And I know how powerful that process can be.  Because growing up, my family -- everybody knows we didn’t come from great wealth, we didn’t have a lot of advantages or luxuries, or things like that.  But my parents always made it clear that the arts -- even though they weren't educated, they knew that the arts -- things like poetry and music and drama and writing -- those things weren’t luxuries, they were necessities.  No matter where you come from, they knew that we needed those experiences to feed our souls and to make us whole and complete individuals.  

So they did everything in their power, spent every penny they didn’t have to make sure we had piano lessons -- and I see the parents nodding -- enrolling us in summer programs at our church where we’d put on plays and we’d do musical performances. I was actually a little fairy once, and I had to sing.  (Laughter.)  I wasn’t a good singer, but -- (laughter) -- somehow that must have done something for me in the end.  My parents encouraged me to become a writer myself.  

So as a kid, when I was feeling anxious or bored or lonely, I would often sit down and just write and write and write.  And I would get lost in that writing.  And it helped me on so many levels to be able to pour out feelings and frustrations onto paper.  And then eventually I would always feel a little better, more empowered, more in control.

And like many young people, I didn’t just get the emotional benefits of writing, I also got the academic benefits as well.  Because as I improved my writing, just because it was fun and it was an outlet, I also improved my thinking –- I was better able to organize my thoughts in class.  I was better able to clearly express my ideas on papers and exams.  It was second nature.

And that’s the power of the arts in our schools.  We talk about this all the time:  The arts can actually make kids better students.  And we lose sight of that fact when we eliminate these kind of opportunities.  This is the stuff that hooks kids in.  And the evidence is crystal clear:  Kids who get involved in the arts, they have higher grades.  They have higher graduation rates.  They have higher college enrollment rates.  We could go on and on and on.

So arts education isn’t just a luxury that we add on after we’ve achieved other priorities like raising test scores and getting kids into college.  And we say this every time we do an event.  These are not luxuries, these are absolute necessities.  It’s actually critical to achieving those initial priorities in the first place. 

So I have an assignment for you guys -- and we all get this assignment, don't we?  I want you all to be ambassadors for the arts, all right?  You are now chosen to go out there and spread the word and to share your gift with as many people as you can.

And I’m sure that you all know plenty of kids in your communities, in your families who can’t even imagine being where you are today, standing in this room with all these folks -– kids who’ve never written a poem.  They’ve never even written down a thought maybe even.  Kids who never read great poets like Jacqueline, they don't know she exists -- I want you all to find those kids in your lives.  Find them, seek them out.  And some of you are older siblings, so you've young people right in your own orbit who are watching you every step of the way.  I want you to ask your teachers to make sure they're including poetry in their lesson plans.  Be that advocate in your schools and your communities.  Reach out to folks who live around you and could probably use some poetry in their lives, right? 

Past National Student Poets have shared their passion for poetry with military families, with Alzheimer’s patients, with incarcerated women.  This is sort of the legacy they’ve left.  They’ve done really good work once they’ve left this room to keep spreading the word.  

And I want to be clear -- you don’t have to find the perfect poem to share.  It’s not really even about the perfect work.  It doesn't have to be your most polished final draft.  It doesn't have to be perfect.

I think Chasity said it best -- and this is something she said in one of her poems -- she said:  “We’ll use every rusted coin to purchase blessings, and buy plane tickets to destiny.”

I love that.  Love that.  And I promise you all that the words you share with others will be blessings -– both to them and to you.   And I want you all to spread those blessings.  I want you to help other young people buy their own plane tickets to destiny –- maybe even to the White House.  You may inspire the next National Student Poets to be standing right here.

I know you all can do this.  Every year we have great young people who take this pledge and go on to do some wonderful things.  This is the beginning of something phenomenal for each and every one of you.  And I am so excited for you.  And I don't want you to be nervous about it.  I don't want you -- I want you to feel empowered by it.  You all can do this.  You made it to this point.  There is nothing you can't do.  And you've all these people who are so proud of you.  It’s such a rare gift -- treasure it, share it, make it grow even bigger.

So with that, I want to thank everyone for joining us again today.  And I can’t wait to hear all these young people who are going to do a few readings from their work, my favorite part.  So I think I’m supposed to sit down, and you guys know everything else you're supposed to do, right?  (Laughter.) I can get out of the way.  Thank you, guys.  (Applause.)  

(Poems are read.)

MRS. OBAMA:  Wow!  What do you say?  What do you say?  I'm supposed to close this out, but I'm speechless.  This is I think one of the most beautiful moments that we have here at the White House.  And you all have to agree that we're sitting in this historic place, with young people who represent all of America, with such talent and passion.  This is special time.  This doesn’t happen all the time.  It should happen more, in more special places all around the world, quite frankly.  And hopefully, we all leave here inspired to do more of this -- to lift up these young people and to encourage them and empower them to go out and change the world, because you all clearly can.  You will.  You are.

Jacqueline, thank you for those words, for that inspiration you’ve given them, for the words that show them their power, for being that mentor.  It's beautiful.

Ashley, we're so proud of you.  You have grown so much.  That's the other thing that's wonderful to watch, is like who you guys will be, what your voices will look like in just a year.  Ashley is like -- you know, you're like a little old lady -- (laughter) -- just all self-possessed and clear and confident in a way that just points out how powerful and impactful this year can be -- and will be for all of you.  

Olivia, thank you for that video.  I will say, I don't get to see their year; I get to see the beginning and the end.  But this program, this year of service is at the cornerstone of this. This pinning, this day, this is cool, right?  You’ll remember it, right?  You’ll tell your kids about it.  Don't lose your pins, okay?  (Laughter.)  But it's the work that you're going to do for the remainder of the year that is really going to change your whole construct of your lives.  And so embrace this year.  It looks like it's going to be so much fun.  I would trade my coming year -- (laughter) -- with your coming year.  I would do that.  (Laughter.)  

But, again, we are proud of you, very proud of you.  And it is always an honor to spend this time with you all, and to watch you grow, and to hear your words.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And congratulations.

You all, thank you for being here.  Enjoy.  We'll see you next year?  Yeah, we will.  (Applause.)  

Thank you, Mr. President.  It's an honor to be here at the White House Summit for Worker Voice.  And we're really excited to share with you what we've learned today from everybody.

Well, first of all, I hope everybody has had a good time, and I hope the conversations have been useful.  I know that my team that has participated has been incredibly excited and inspired by all the energy and insight and stories that people have told throughout the day.

So my goal is to learn from you.  But I'm also happy to give you my perspective in terms of where we can take this.  My hope is at the end of this session that we can agree to put together some sort of plans for follow-up.  Because the goal here was not to end a conversation; the goal was to begin a conversation, widen it, broaden it, solicit additional ideas from folks who weren't able to participate here today, and then see whether, as a consequence of this ongoing collaboration, we start building a much bigger conversation across the country.

So, Michelle, why don't you kick us off?

Sure.  So I'll tell you a little about Coworker.org.  We're a platform where people can just join together to improve their working conditions and have a voice in their workplace.  And we see worker voice not just as a voice to your boss but also a voice to each other so people can communicate together to improve things.

And this week, we were a platform for a voice to you.  So we got thousands of submissions from our community about what people were wrestling with around changing things in their workplaces and improving their conditions.  And the number-one theme that we heard from folks was that their jobs are changing; the economy is at a moment of restructuring, and everybody from free-lancers to restaurant workers to manufacturing workers are seeing these changes in the workplace.  And they know that we have an opportunity to make those jobs awesome, but we're only going to do that if we have a voice in how they're shaped.

So I can bring up our first question.  It is from Rochelle (ph) in Los Angeles.  She is a gig coder, so she gets coding jobs from an online platform.  And she represents a lot of the questions that we got from folks working in the emerging on-demand economy and then the digital economy.  And she wants to know, how can America better support workers who are working in a digital space and face difficulties, such as a lack of in-person contact, a lack of support from online platforms themselves, and a lack of tools with which to improve their jobs?

Well, it's a great question.  And I think it's important to recognize that the on-demand economy or the share economy is still a fraction of the overall economy, and the overwhelming majority of people still work for employers and go to offices and go to factories.  And so we have to not get too distracted as if suddenly everything has been transformed.

But what is absolutely true is there's this underlying trend where companies, because they have a lot of data that they can process, because of bottom-line pressures, because of the quarterly report shareholder pressures that they're under, and interests in cost-cutting are, across the economy, juggling schedules, pay and benefit systems, promotion systems -- all of which are really disruptive.

And so somebody in the digital space, or somebody in the online -- or on-demand economy is really just one end of this broader spectrum of changes that are taking place across the board.  And what that means is, number one, we have to make sure that workers across sectors understand that their fates are connected; that you can't think, okay, I'm in a union in a factory with a traditional contract and pension, and so I don't have to worry about what's happening to that worker over there.  Because the same problems they're dealing with eventually you may be dealing with.  So that's point number one.

Point number two is that there are going to be certain benefits that traditionally we got through employers that we're going to have to make sure are available to people who are not in a traditional workplace, or are not going to be working for 30 years at a single place.

And to some degree, the Affordable Care Act was designed to fill the gaps.  Eighty-five percent of the people in the country get their health insurance through their employers.  But if they lost their job, if they wanted to start a business, if they're young and they're entering into the on-demand economy, they had no place to go.

So some of our job here is to make sure that for somebody like Rochelle, she's got other ways of accessing benefits that traditionally she was getting through the job.  And that means that, whether it's at the federal level or at the local level, thinking about how do we get paid leave, unemployment insurance, child care help -- how do we get some of these goods packaged so that -- primarily we're getting them through employers, and we continue to put pressure on employers through unions and through organizing to give a better deal to workers -- but also, if people are falling through those cracks, how can we fill those cracks effectively.  So that's point number two.

Point number three is, for us to -- I understand that in some of the sessions people pointed out that consumers have power.  And typically, if you are in one of these digital spaces, a lot of those companies are pretty sensitive to PR and the barriers to entry are not that high.  And if I have a choice between choosing a company that is providing me some sort of IT help, and they've got a reputation for being really good to the people who are working for them, and another company that has a reputation for being really bad to the people who are working for them, I'm going to choose the people who are doing the right thing.

So I think part of this is going to be making sure that we help link folks like Rochelle to the people in this room and to unions and others so that there is a workers' movement across the economy.  Number two, figuring out where are there gaps in benefits and security that was traditionally provided through employers, and we can fill those gaps through national policy or state and local policy.  And number three, enlisting consumers to help put pressure on companies to do the right thing by their workers.

And all that requires organizing, and that is always an important piece of business in whatever it is that we're going to be trying to accomplish.

Absolutely.  And I know that folks in the room also have some stories about organizing around lifting up workers and this economy. Earlier today, Eijen (ph) was speaking on a panel and talked about the Good Work Code that just got launched yesterday.  And I wonder if you'd like to share that with us.

We got a mic?  We won't be able to hear you. 

Thank you for the opportunity.  At the National Domestic Workers Alliance, we represent nannies, caregivers and housekeepers around the country.  And as we started to talk to more workers in the on-demand economy, we realize that they face many of the same challenges -- lack of stability, lack of predictability of hours and of work, and of access to a safety net.  And so we worked with a lot of those workers and our members to develop what we call the Good Work Code, which is a set of eight simple values for how to make the on-demand economy a really good place for the people who are working there.

And we want to work together with companies and the workers and all the people in the workers' movement to actually move towards those shared values, because we think that there's a lot of promise that the on-demand economy can hold if we actually make sure that it's a great place for the people who work there.  So the Good Work Code.

And I would also say to Rochelle that I hope she joins an organization, because we need people to be organized and build this movement.  Join a union or an organization.

Can I ask a follow-up question?  And that is, the Good Work Code that you developed -- obviously, that only works if you've got a couple of key industry leaders who sign up and then you've got customers who are willing to put some pressure on others in the space and in the industry.  And give me a sense of how that worked initially with nannies and daycare workers and so forth, and how -- what were some of the biggest barriers to getting started and getting moving on that?

Q    Well, one, we really needed to tap into networks and get the word out that we were organizing.  And now, technology actually enables -- like through organizations like Coworker.org -- there's a real, enormous opportunity to scale our ability to get the word out.  And with employers, what we found was a lot of employers wanted to do the right thing and it just wasn't clear what that was.  There were no standards, no guidelines.  Many parts of the economy are like a Wild West, where there really isn't -- there aren't clear standards and guidelines.

And so one of the things we all need to do is actually promote good standards, really be clear about what those are -- which is part of what the Good Work Code is about -- and then spread the word among our networks, leverage platforms like this one to talk about opportunities to work together and come together to move forward.

In the work with domestic workers, we actually found a lot of employers did support -- their caregivers and their nannies are part of the backbone of how their households function every day.  It's the work that makes all other work possible.  And we also found that legislators taking action, passing a domestic worker bill of rights, and really supporting legislation that makes clear what the standards are and should be, that this is real work that deserves dignity like all work -- that that sent a really important message to everyone -- employers, families and workers alike.

So I think it's an all-hands-on-deck situation where we need consumers, we need families, we need legislators to take action, to set standards.  We need all of us to help enforce those standards and really carry out the kind of culture change that will support worker voice in the 21st century.

Well, I am persuaded.  (Laughter and applause.)  So you're doing great work.

Michelle, I hope you don't mind, I'm going to hijack the format here just for a second, because I want to have a follow-up that I think is particularly relevant to this group -- and this is an undercurrent, as we were organizing this.

I am a big believer, as you heard me say at the opening, of collective bargaining and unions as a tool to empower workers.  And I think that the work that you just described in terms of good conduct is something that is profoundly needed.  But then I'm interested in how do we prevent that from being a watered-down version of the protections and rights that a union provides.

And so since Mary Kay is sitting right here -- (laughter) -- and SEIU not only organizes similar cohorts but also has been really supportive of creative partnerships, even with folks who are non-union, I thought it would be a great time for maybe Mary Kay just to talk about how we should think about supporting traditional union efforts and strengthening laws where we can, and, at the same time, reaching into these new areas where, for whatever reason -- because of geography, because of industry -- we may not right away be able to get a collective bargaining union, but we don't want those folks to feel as if they're not being served at all and nobody is hearing them.

So why don't you tell us about that.

Thank you so much, Mr. President.  The Terrence Wise story that you told and that Terrence told this morning is the first thought I have as you pose the question, which is, the way fast-food workers work is for a franchise owner where the decisions are made at the corporate level.  And in our country, the current labor law doesn't promote the ability to think in the way that Terrence has done, which is 4 million fast-food workers have the same conditions.  He considers himself a global movement leader.  And can we imagine the principles that you outlined -- work that you can raise a family on, retirement security, and health benefits that you can count on; the ability to form a union without retaliation -- Terrence has been fired, returned to work.  He experiences retaliation every day for standing up.

But could we imagine with the employers in this room -- that was a question I wanted to pose -- when you think about the incredible employer work, imagine if the 10 percent of the employers who respect those guidelines were able to make an appeal to employers across the economy, because 4 million fast-food workers being able to have a national agreement with the multinational corporations in the U.S. like they do in countries around the globe -- which is outside of our current system -- but these workers are creating through their guts and fearlessness and courage, and you're helping to frame by these principles, as a standard that 64 million workers across the service and care sector should be able to expect.

Just like Lou Berry, who is a UPMC worker in Pittsburgh, trying to form a union for four years -- I believe has been fired twice, returned by the NLRB to his job because of retaliation, and because you help appoint people to the NLRB and helped change the rules.  But still his employer won't behave like Kaiser Permanente, who's decided that workers having a voice can actually reduce cost of health care and improve quality for patients.

So I think you're right, that we have to think about how do we make the law that can work for hospital workers who formed unions, but how do we invent through the support of workers, and then getting good employers in this room to call on the rest of the employers to respect work.

And there's two other people -- Pavone Scott (ph) said to me as we left today, she goes, I'm a child care provider in Florida. There's 2 million of us.  I got to figure out how to create an employer, because I'm subsidized, for my children through the state.  There isn't really a direct employer relationship -- 2 million women work like that.  She cares deeply about the children she serves, but no paid time off, no vacation, no sick leave, no Social Security.  There's just what Eijen (ph) was talking about, like how do we think about who she cares for and loves but apply your principles in a way that she could imagine for the tens of thousands of women that do that work in Florida. But really what you want is 2 million women who care for children ought to be respected as much as people that build and make things in this country.  And that's what we'd like to pose today.

And I just want to say that -- I think Secretary Perez told us we will be inspired and challenged.  And I've been really provoked by the collection, the cross-section of us, and that we can imagine how 4 million people could have a collective agreement in fast-food, 2 million women in child care.  But we have to think on a scale that you've challenged us to consider.  And I'm grateful to be here.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

So this leads us actually really nicely into our next question, which is from a campaign creator on our own site.  Aliyah (ph) -- she works in North Carolina.  She's a restaurant worker.  And on her own, she's brought business owners, local elected, customers and workers to the table to raise standard in Asheville, North Carolina for restaurant workers, and to get local businesses to agree to be committed to actually brand restaurants and other places as, this is a great place to work so it should be a great place to buy.

And she asks what more can be done at a federal level to help people like her raise standards in her industry?

Well, you know what's interesting is that -- and this all connects with what's been said previously.  Traditionally there were two tools for workers to have a voice.  One was employers need good employees, and particularly if you had a tight labor market, then employers felt compelled to hire good people and try to keep good people.  And that continues to be important.

But the other was unions were there to make sure that not only at the workplace, and wages and health benefits, that there were some direct negotiations and the workers were at the table and thinking about what was fair for them and that they weren't treated arbitrarily, but also they provided enormous muscle and lift for us to then get federal, state, and local legislation passed.

But there always have been gaps.  And I think the restaurant industry is an example where a lot of federal law did not reach into restaurants the way they should -- which is why, for example, waiters and waitresses and how tips were treated was oftentimes substandard.

And it's not likely -- I'm going to be honest -- that during the remainder of my presidency Congress passes laws to raise standards for restaurant workers.  So I think the work that Aliyah is doing -- Asheville, by the way, is a great town.  So those of you who have not been there -- and great restaurants.  But the kind of work that Aliyah is doing and some of you describe of creating new norms and social pressures at the local level with employers and with customers is a really powerful tool.

And I emphasize the customer side of this because I think most of us are price sensitive and we're not looking to overpay.
On the other hand, I'll bet a lot of folks here, if they go to a restaurant and they know that the people working there are making a living wage, the fact that they might be paying an extra dollar for a burger would feel okay.  Some people might not be able to afford it, but a lot of people could.  It's just you're not thinking about it.  And when you make people conscious that there's a connection between how employers [employees] are treated and the purchases you're making, I think that can have an impact.

I think at the federal level, the minimum wage law is hugely important for restaurant workers.  And since we're not, so far, getting traction at the federal level, the 30 cities and counties that are raising the minimum wage -- and making sure that that minimum wage includes the tip provisions that have been introduced in the legislation that is stalled right now in Congress is really important -- that's one of the most important immediate things that we can do to support folks in the restaurant industry, but also in large chunks of the service industry, generally.

And the last point I want to make, which Aliyah alludes to, in the same way that a lot of us as customers aren't always thinking about workers but we're just thinking about what we're buying and the service we're getting, and we don't make that connection, there are a lot of employers who are actually really good people -- particularly small businesses -- but they're operating on tight margins and they're under pressure.  And part of our goal has to be to work with companies and employers, starting with the folks who are industry leaders oftentimes because -- oftentimes the most profitable -- and to highlight the way that if you have good management, you can actually do right by your employees and still outperform and outcompete others.

And we always use as an example Costco, which the starting salary the last time I checked and the last time I was in a Costco was, what, a year and a half ago, maybe two years ago, but the starting salary for a cashier was like $11.50 or something.  And there were tracks whereby somebody who started at the cash register was suddenly the manager of one of the sections of the store.  They all had health benefits throughout.  They were union-friendly.  And if you look at their stock, they've performed as well as some of their biggest competitors or better.

So what does that tell us?  What it tells us is that this idea that in order for you to do good as a company you've got to squeeze your workers as hard as possible is a fallacy.  But part of the problem in this conversation, and part of the reason we thought it was important to invite some of these employers with best practices, is that so often in the debate this gets framed as a business-versus-labor thing, as opposed to business and labor who are doing the right thing versus business that are trapped in a bad relationship with their workers and are relying on outdated models of rapid turnover and low wages and no benefits.  And the more we can shift to shine a spotlight on those good practices and those effective companies, and to help those companies then work with other companies across industries -- and that's where I think this good conduct and good employer standards comes in -- that can make a really powerful difference over the long term.

And it sounds like Aliyah is doing that in her local level, and that's something that I think we all have to learn from.

Lola Smallwood Cuevas, from the Black River Justice Center, told a great story today about the ways in which they've been able to raise standards in Los Angeles.  And I'd love for her to share that story -- both with Aliyah, who is listening, and with you.  She's right there.

There you go.

Q    Thank you, and thank you for the opportunity and for convening this amazing and inspiring day.  In L.A., what we're doing is community unionism -- black workers who are in horrific crisis are partnering with unions, we're partnering with other worker centers, community-based organizations to make a difference and to create pathways.

And we've had some success, thanks to the administration's special rule that helps us to have targeted hiring in our city and to make that an opportunity for workers who want to get into good construction careers.  We're excited about the pilot, which is going to create even more opportunities for workers to get access to jobs, and we're hoping to see changes that will allow now for us to begin to really do -- to modernize industry culture so that we can ensure that African American workers and women have an opportunity to make construction a career that can support them, their families, and communities.

We're doing that at a very small scale in Los Angeles, but the most -- simplest -- what we see as a simple rule update would go a long way to making a difference in the lives of workers.  And so as we're building this new, sort of untraditional model of organizing and unionization in our communities, we'd love to see more support around how do we create new industries that are open to all, and create more equitable workforce.  (Applause.)

Well, I think we're very proud of what Lola said.  Look, something Lola said that I suspect the economists in the room will heartily agree with, and that is that -- remember what I said in terms of leverage with workers at the outset.  One of the best pieces of leverage is a tight labor market.  So I don't want to ignore the fact that smart policies that, for example, finance the $2 trillion worth of infrastructure repair that we need in this country would be a really powerful tool to give workers more of a voice, because now you got a whole bunch of folks who are engaged in jobs that can't be exported.

Those transportation or public works projects that are taking place in your community, Lola, now provide a platform for apprenticeship programs and a pipeline for bringing in the unemployed into the job market.  It makes it a lot easier for us to have discussions about fair pay and fair wages and reduced turnover and sick leave.

 

So this conversation does not replace the need for us to have economic policies that are going to help grow the economy faster and put more people to work.  And there's more that we can do.

I'm very proud -- we came in at 10 percent unemployment and we're down to 5.1.  But what we also know is people are underemployed; people are fearful of job change.  And typically, that's how you get a raise, is oftentimes going to a new job -- or at least having the option of going to a new job, so your employer says, hold on a second, what do you need to stay?  And so there is still slack in the economy, and we could be doing more.  Congress could be doing more in order to alleviate some of that.

But that's not the primary focus of our conversation.  I just wanted to make sure we didn't lose that thread, because I don't want us to let our policymakers off the hook in terms of encouraging policies that will have businesses grow faster.

Part of the reason -- when I talk to employers -- and some of these are really big, successful employers -- is they say, you know what, if the economy is only growing at 2 percent, 2.5 percent per year, I can make a profit without ever hiring additional people.  And if I start seeing some growing demand, I've probably saved enough, I've got enough money in the bank that I can automate a little bit more and it's easier for me to control my costs.

So there's a big difference between let's say 2 percent growth and 3 or 3.5 percent growth.  And we could achieve 3 and 3.5 percent growth even in this new economy if we weren't doing some counterproductive things, some of which are compounded by even more counterproductive things being proposed in some of these presidential debates -- but that's whole other piece of business.  (Laughter.)  This is not a political event.

So you'll be glad to know that you and John from Lima, Ohio, have a lot in common.  He also is very concerned about the growing use of permatemps -- and would likely agree with you that he hates that word, like you said this morning.  So he has been watching people he knows working at companies for up to six years as temporary workers, and he wants to know, frankly, is there anything that can be done at all?

I think there is.  But this is an area where we're probably going to need some changes in the law in order to provide more levers to get companies who are not doing the right thing to do the right thing.  And some of you probably heard Tom Perez talk about some of these issues earlier, maybe in some of the workshops, but the broader audience that may be watching at this point, since I assume this is being live-streamed somewhere, may want to hear it.  So why don't we give Tom the mic -- because he has been spending a lot of time thinking about this at Department of Labor.

There are a lot of issues around classification, overtime, temporary workers, independent contractors versus actual employees.  And there are a lot of games being played to get around both collective bargaining, but also to get around overtime pay, getting around paying basic benefits.  And that means we're going to have to, in some cases, redefine what we think of as employees.  And that's going to be a tough lift.

Tom?

Thank you, Mr. President.  The first thing that comes to mind is a conversation we had this morning.  We heard from Robert who is a permatemp.  Robert, you still here?  Oh, here he is, right here.

And then we talked about the issue of culture -- what kind of culture do you want to have in your workplace.  And we heard from Kaiser.  We heard from Market Basket.  You talk to New Belgium Brewery, you talk to Container Store, you talk to that guy from Shinola, and you see they've created --

Yes, absolutely.  And bicycles.  And you see the culture they've created.  It's a culture in which they understand that their most precious resource is their human capital.  And I asked I think it was Joe from Market Basket, how could you have a situation, Joe, where you had two Market Basket employees, both there for six years, and one was a temporary employee making a fraction of what the other person was making.  And he said that's totally inconsistent with our culture.  It wouldn't happen, I think were your exact words, Joe.  And we heard that from so many other people.

So step number one, and it gets back to some of what Eijen was saying -- is when we have this code of conduct, permatemps are inconsistent with inclusive capitalism.  And so I think we should start with that.

What we also have in terms of regulatory tools, as you referenced, and as Senator Obama, he was focused on this issue because what we have seen, regrettably, with some degree of frequency over recent years is that employers at times will misclassify someone.  Someone who acts like an employee should be an employee and they're called an independent contractor.  When I was in Maryland working on this issue -- it's called misclassification here in Washington.  I don't like that word because that sounds like you put it in the wrong file.  We called it in Maryland what I thought it was, which was workplace fraud, and where I grew up, it was called cheating.  (Laughter.)

And the victims of cheating are the employee who is called an independent contractor when he or she should be a worker.  The victims are employers who play by the rules.  And one of the most frequent sets of complaintants in our cases are employers -- I'm paying my workers, I'm paying their worker's comp, I'm treating them like an employee, I'm trying to bid on contracts, I keep getting low-balled by that company who is paying everyone cash under the table.  So you've got employer victims.  And then the tax collector is a victim.

And we hear a lot in the worker's comp context about worker's comp programs are starting to have trouble with their fiscal stability and it's because they've got a denominator problem.  There's not enough people paying into the system.  And that's because there's cheating going on.  And so we spend a lot of time on this issue.

There's an appropriate place for independent contractors, there absolutely is, but we have seen with all too much frequency dishwashers called independent contractors, dry-wallers were employees on a Friday and then they're independent contractors on a Monday.  We see it across sectors.

And so these are some of the issues -- and we have a pretty robust practice.  And then Senator Obama had a bill that dealt with this at a federal level, and we do a lot of work at a state level because it's about leveling the playing field.  And so many people feel frustrated, and they don't want to speak up because  -- and I heard this last night, Mr. President, when we met with six or seven workers.  The most frequent thing I heard is, I know I can do better, but I'm scared to come forward.  That's why Robert today is a pretty heroic figure for being here, because they're scared.  And John in Lima is seeing this firsthand and we see it -- we've got a pretty robust practice in this.  (Applause.)

So speaking of employer culture, I wanted to bring up the next question that we got from a young worker in Atlanta, Georgia named Christy (ph), who organized thousands of her coworkers mostly using social media.  And young workers are  -- they're used to being able to talk about everything online and to having an open conversation about what's happening in their workplaces and in their lives and in their families.  And she wants to know, how do we encourage employers to embrace worker voice?  Because as we know, this new generation of workers are going to be speaking out more, using all of the platforms at their disposal, and she wants to make sure that they're able to do so without fear of retaliation.

Well, look, every employer is going to have some sensitivities about the people who are working for them grumbling.  I mean, that's just the nature of things, because they're worrying about their bottom lines and they're worrying about competitive pressures, and they're trying to keep everything together.  And there's a natural defensiveness I think that we all have -- when I try to tell my daughters to do something, they're not my employees, clearly -- (laughter) -- they're kind of, what are you talking about?  But what you discover, as I said earlier, is, is that the best employers, the most effective employers are the ones who are actively soliciting worker input.

And when you create a culture in which the worker knows that their opinions are valued, that in turn means that they're more invested in the success of the company and seeing their ideas moving forward.  And this was, by the way, the principle at the heart of how the Japanese automakers cleaned Detroit's clock for a long time until -- even though we invented this idea of continuous improvement, a lot of it had to do with listening to what folks on the ground were saying.  Because if you were up in the board room, you didn't know what was going to make the assembly line work better, you weren't going to figure out how are we going to reduce our error rates.  The folks who were going to figure it out were the folks who, every day, were sitting staring at this stuff and saying, you know what, this is a stupid way of doing things, and we should do it this way.

So already -- and represented here are employers who understand that and they're actively soliciting input.  The question, though, is when it comes to some more sensitive areas like wages, are employers, even good employers, as open.  And I think that this is where the culture issue that Tom raised is important.  And this is where consumer pressure is important.  To the extent that employers recognize they'll have better employees by listening to employees, and the employees feel safe enough to then say, you know what, we're having problems because what you're paying us right now doesn't pay the rent, and we know that a bunch of us are having to moonlight, and we're dog-tired when we come to work, and if you gave us a little bit of paid sick leave you'll get it back because people will feel so much more loyal to you -- if they're open to hearing that, then -- or if it's a safe space for them to be able to say that, then those companies will find ways of doing it and, in fact, ultimately be even more profitable.

But that's why it's important for us to lift up those companies that are doing exactly that.  Look at best practices.  And I'd be interested, maybe some of the companies who are here might have a comment on how they built that culture.

And we've got Kaiser Permanente represented, we've got Shinola represented -- some great employers here.  Anybody here, the employers, want to talk about what allowed you to make that cultural shift?  And here's the other question, though -- be honest about why even employers of goodwill might be hesitant to provide more voice to workers, and what are the ways in which we can break down some of those barriers and make employers less defensive or less worried about it.

Anybody?  Tom, you want to try it out?

Q    So I think what you're saying about consumers having a lot of power is really important.  And I think in today's world, brains are really being born on the inside.  So I have an example of when it really hit me.  First of all, what we were trying to do, first of all, is a philanthropic thing.  We were going to create a company that had 100 employees.  We were going to make watches for other watch companies like Tiffany and Lovato.  And we had to make some watches to show our customers what we could make.  And so we made 2,500 watches that we were going to ship in three or four months.  And we were asking customers to pay $550 in advance for a watch that we were barely sure we could make -- nobody had ever touched it before.  And we had a picture of our workers as our marketing.  And the demand came through the roof.
And it hit me at that moment that people are responding to what's going on inside the companies.  People want to know where their food is being made.  People want to know who is making their products.  And that's really what we're focused on is making them happy.  So if people come to our factory and they see people making double minimum wage, and giving people hugs instead of other things that are going on, I think that it comes through in the product.  And that's what we're trying to do.  (Applause.)

Again, thank you for this great day.  It's been great to participate.  I feel really fortunate.  As I said earlier, Kaiser has been on a long journey in terms of our labor- management partnership.  And there are several things.  One is really hard work.  No one should assume that it's easy.

And part of the work has been to really educate and train our leaders and managers differently so that they understand that being able to engage and to share power, to share decision-making doesn't make them less in terms of leadership.  It's also been a process of where we've had to really work with and educate our union partners.  And we do that together, because they come to the table differently, because we come owning what is it that we're trying to solve, what is the organization's interest, what is labor's interest and how do we own this and how do we work it through?

The other thing I would say is that I think in terms of people who haven't walked this path or haven't been there, there is this sense of giving up power.  There is this element of fear. I mentioned earlier that as we bring new leaders into the organization, sometimes they struggle with what does it mean to kind of engage with a unit-based team?  What does it mean to let the team own and do this work?

One my colleagues here at in LVN from Colorado is actually with us.  One of the unit-based teams in Colorado that has been working on post-acute discharge actually reduced the return admission rate for our Medicare patients by 50 percent and saved like $6 million.  And they did that because the physicians, the staff came together, they identified the indicators that were causing patients to come back into the hospital.  They developed the tool.  They focused the homecare -- the visits on those indicators and actually improved care, improved service, and made us more affordable.

So our experience has been that while it's hard work -- because we have to be focused on the entries, we have to listen  -- we also have to free up people's ability to share with us.  Because, culturally, when you're the CEO or you've got different roles, people have to become comfortable engaging with you as an equal.  So we have to allow people to be present to us and be present with them.

THE PRESIDENT:  I think that's a great point.  And on the other side -- because you mentioned unions had to change some of their attitudes and thinking, as well -- one of the virtuous cycles that you want to get into is a situation where the workers feel valued and listened to, which means that when a company has a problem, a challenge, a change that has to be made, now because the workers remember, yes, I've got paid sick leave, and, yes, the employers always treated me fairly, so I'm going to come in with a mindset of how do we solve this problem, as opposed to, no to whatever changes.

And that I think is a lot of times what some businesses may fear -- not that they're trying to hurt workers, but they may not have flexibility to respond to a changing marketplace.

And one of my favorite stories -- and I talked about this in Osawatomie when I made a speech about economic fairness and inequality -- was a story of a company that, during the depths of the recession in 2008, 2009, 2010 -- and I forget what kind of -- it was a manufacturer, but it was a family-owned company, and because they felt that their workers were family, and because they felt that there was a community behind them, they said, we won't take a salary until we get us out of this hole.  The workers then said, rather than lay off a bunch of people, we'll all engage in a work-share and reduce pro rata how much we're taking in, but that way nobody is bearing the full burden of this thing.

And in a couple of years, they had come out of it stronger than ever.  But the point was that they had already established this culture.  And it wasn't just the employers, it was also the employees.  But the employees had to see that the employer was setting an example of caring about them.

And I do think that -- as President, I meet with a lot of CEOs.  And a lot of them are really smart people and they're producing really good things, and highly philanthropic.  But part of the reason issues of CEO compensation are sensitive to folks is not because workers are jealous and they want lifestyles of the rich and famous, it's the sense that if, in fact, there are greater competitive pressures out there, how much is everybody willing to give up to meet those competitive pressures as opposed to putting it all on the backs of workers.  (Applause.)  And that I think is -- that's a mindset that has to change.

And that also, by the way, is fed by, in public companies, this quarterly report mentality, which is challenging to change. Because our economy is designed right now -- bonuses, incentives, whether a CEO keeps his job -- so much of it is just based on short-term profits, and it makes it much more difficult.  The company I just described was not a public company, so they could make a decision without a bunch of shareholder pressure.

And one of the things I've been wrestling with and talking to our teams about is, are there ways to nudge the economy in a direction where companies can make longer-term investments, invest in their workers, understanding that it may not pay off this quarter, but we're going to be a stronger company five years down the road or 10 years down the road.

But this is really deeply embedded right now in how our economy -- how so many of our public companies think, even when a lot of the CEOs will express privately that they'd like to be thinking more long term.

All right, fair enough.  So the next question came to us from Sunday, a freelancer in New York.  And she reflected a lot of the questions that we got not just from freelancers but a lot of folks who were struggling with pay.  And her particular question was about the fact that sometimes freelancers aren't even paid for their work, and there are no mechanisms available to them right now to actually insist on being paid aside from small claims court.  And so her question is, what will you do to help both small business owners and freelancers actually get paid for their work?

 This is a great question, and I don't have an immediate answer.  When it comes to federal contracts, one of the things that smart people like Jason Furman, my current chair of the Council for Economic Advisers, and Gene Sperling, former head of our National Economic Council, thought of while we were still trying to find ways to boost business and aggregate demand -- they figured out, you know what, a bunch of our small businesses who are subcontractors or down the supply chain to the federal government, they're not getting paid long enough -- or fast enough.

And it doesn't matter when -- well, I won't say it doesn't matter -- but Boeing may be able to survive it, taking a little bit longer to get paid, but some of their smaller suppliers cannot.  And we actually changed how our payment systems worked to accelerate it, and it really helped a lot of small businesses. I mean, we loosened up a bunch of money into the economy.  Those are the kinds of tricks you work on, particularly when Congress isn't passing the laws that you need for them to pass to boost the economy.

But I haven't actually spent a lot of time thinking about are there best practices that we could institute.  But what I do know is the federal government, state governments, city governments, they're big employers and they're big consumers -- obviously, the federal government is the largest consumer in the world -- and so setting up best practices for them then can encourage best practices to be adopted throughout a particular industry.

But, Jason, anything else you want to add on that?  Any other ideas that we've had?  Because I'm sure this is something that has come up with SBA and others -- oh, wait, we've got a volunteer.

Sarah Horowitz has been leading the way on these questions.

Q    Well, I like to say help is on the way.  So thank you so much and thank you, Mr. President, for this really exceptional time to really be breaking ground and thinking about the next frontier, and to the great Michelle Miller and Coworker for their great work.

So in New York City right now, we have Freelancers Union -- it's a national organization, 300,000 members of freelancers -- who have not been misclassified -- who really do the great work of the country and really contribute in so many ways.  And one of their biggest challenges is that they don't get paid.  The average freelancer has been stiffed $6,000 a year; 70 percent of all freelancers have experienced nonpayment at some point in their life.  And that's why we are launching the "Freelancing Isn't Free" campaign.  (Laughter.)

 I will say, though, next time you need a bigger poster.  (Laughter.)  Because for those of us over 50 it becomes harder to read.  Anyway, go ahead.  I'm teasing.

Q    And while the press is taking pictures, let me say that's the hashtag, because at the City Council, we are now having legislation that will make it that you -- a company has to hire a freelancer with a contract, and we are hoping that they will have double damages, attorneys' fees, so that freelancers can get paid.

The second problem is freelancing now, as I think you were alluding to, is on a 30-60-90 day invoicing system.  Imagine if you did work and you didn't get paid for three months.  It's just really unconscionable, and some of the biggest companies are doing this.  And so this is a national campaign joined by great unions like the Teachers Union, 32BJ SEIU, The Domestic Workers, so many others to really say this -- getting paid is one of the most important things.  So help is on the way, as we like to say. (Applause.)
Yes, one more.  So this is a short one.  Michael from D.C. wants to know how the White House can help to raise awareness about worker co-ops as a source of good jobs, which I think -- baked into the structure of worker co-ops is worker voice.

We had someone applaud right here and this is one of our great partners working on a whole range of issues so go ahead, please.

Q    Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I think that is a very, very important --

Introduce yourself, first of all, to everybody.

Q    My name is Gustavo Torres from CASA.  Thank you very much.  This is a very, very important issue and we believe that that is the way how we can bring voice to the workers because -- not only voice but also power.  Because we believe that in addition to have the voice, they are going to be able to share the wealth.  And that is the reason why it is so important that the White House and your administration really review that opportunity to be able to take the proceeds and make sure that the co-ops are treated like more businesses, because that is exactly what they are.  So thank you very much.  (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Well, worker co-ops, employee ownership -- the more we get people invested in business models in a whole range of ways, the more we align workers' interests with the business interests, I think the stronger our economy is going to be.  And it points to some of the ways in which we can make sure we've got broad-based growth.

Let me just wrap up, Michelle, by saying this -- and I want to repeat what I said on the front end.  The genesis of this meeting was conversations that I had with Rich Trumka and Mary Kay and some of the folks who were working in the new on-demand economy and our folks in house, and the belief that for all the successes that we've made in recovering the economy, if we don't solve this problem, then it will have an adverse effect on our long-term competitiveness and it will have an adverse effect on our democracy -- because America works when we are building a broad-based middle class and there are ladders of opportunity that everybody can reach.  And historically, it doesn't work and not only does our economy but our politics also turn in a bad direction when you start seeing huge separations between how folks at the top are doing and everybody else is doing.

And what I said to my team was how can we foster a conversation to start getting more creative -- because we've looked very narrowly at what can we get through Congress, what can the NLRB do, but we haven't come up with as many new models as we need to.

And I used as an example a single mom who is working in an office park somewhere who maybe has been misclassified or is getting cheated, knows that she doesn't have sick leave, doesn't have overtime pay, but, frankly, feels isolated, doesn't have recourse immediately to a union someplace, doesn't have the time -- because she's got to take care of her kids -- doesn't have time to go to a town hall or a union meeting, but would be very interested if she thought that there was a way for her to join up with others in order to promote her interests.  And so that was how this thing got started.

The reason I wanted to share that with you is to say that this is the beginning of a conversation that I want to push for the next 15 months, through the end of my presidency.  And the ideas that have been generated from these groups, we're going to try to collate, we will then distribute.  And then I'll make sure that my team is working with the various organizations and individuals that are represented here to think about how do we then follow up in concrete ways around these issues -- whether that means doing some regional summits or more localized summits to talk about very particular issues; whether it's identifying three or four ideas that have enough traction that we want to start pushing them real hard; whether it is attaching more publicity to a particular organizing drive that's taking place right now, or taking an idea that involves branding good practices and starting to lift that up more.

I don't know yet what you guys will determine are the best ideas, but we're going to be seeking your input.  And that's how we're going to make sure to follow up.

I guess what I'm saying is, is that we provided the platform, but you own this thing.  And so this is not one of those situations where you had a nice time, you took some pictures -- (laughter) -- and then six months from now, you're all like, well, what did Obama do?  That's not the deal here.  (Laughter.)

All right, the deal is I will work with you around the ideas that you identify.  And we'll work together.  And hopefully this will be the start of reversing some trends -- both economic and cultural -- that have been around way too long.

All right?  Thank you, everybody.  Good job.  (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you so much.  (Applause.)  Well, everybody, please have a seat.  Welcome to the White House.  Let me offer at the outset the observation that Terrence could run for something.  (Laughter.)  But we're so grateful to you for sharing your story, for everything you’re doing to organize and inspire Americans across the country.  You already recognized your mom, Joann, another fast-food worker who’s come up today from South Carolina.  This is actually a remarkable moment:  Neither of them make enough money to be able to afford to travel much, so this is the first time Terrence and Joann have seen each other in 10 years.

AUDIENCE:  No!

THE PRESIDENT:  Ten years apart because they don't earn enough to be able to just hop on a plane and visit each other.
The only problem I have with this story is that I am not sure that Joann is old enough to actually be Terrence’s mom -- (laughter) -- based on how she’s looking there. 

Their story describes why we wanted to have this summit.  Their story describes why workers need a voice.  That’s why our Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez, is here -- and I should add, this is a pretty good way for the Labor Secretary to celebrate his birthday.  (Applause.)  

That’s why we’ve got our outstanding leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi here.  (Applause.)  And Senator Al Franken is here.  (Applause.)   And Congressman Gregory Meeks is here, and Congresswoman Frederica Wilson is here -- because they have consistently been on the frontlines of championing the interests and the concerns of ordinary people who are working hard every single day, and aren't asking for the world -- all they’re asking for is dignity and living wages and being able to take care of their families.  

That's why we’ve got business and labor leaders here today, including the head of the AFL-CIO, Rich Trumka, who’s been fighting these issues for decades.  And that's why we've got workers and organizers and tech experts, and so many others at this first-ever White House Summit on Workers Voice.

And we convened this summit because we believe that this is a country where if we work hard, everybody should be able to get ahead; that the story of America has been each successive generation, getting an education where they could, working hard, saving, scrimping, making sure their kids get a little something better, hoping that at the end of the day they’re able to have a home of their own and be able to retire with some dignity and some respect, have basic benefits so that if they get sick, their families aren’t bankrupt.

And make no mistake, Americans have been working harder than ever to bring this country back, to move it forward.  After the worst crisis in my lifetime, back in 2007, we were able to take the unemployment rate that was around 10 all the way down to 5.1. Businesses were shedding about 800,000 jobs a month; today, they’ve created jobs for 67 straight months -- 13.2 million jobs in total.  

When I took office, our auto industry was flat-lining. Manufacturing had been in decline for a decade.  Today, we’re on pace to sell more American cars than in any year since 2001.  (Applause.)  And we’ve seen stronger job growth in manufacturing than any time since the 1990s.  Our manufacturers are coming back; hundreds of thousands of good middle-class jobs are being created.  

When I took office, more than 15 percent of the American people were uninsured; today, only 9.2 percent are uninsured.  For the first time on record, more than 90 percent of Americans have health insurance.  

So we’ve made progress together.  At a time when America’s economy was flat on its back, we took some tough steps, not always popular, and we were able to get the economy growing again.  But what I’ve said all along is that it wasn’t enough just to get back to where we were before the financial crisis, before Lehman’s, before the Great Recession.  We had to tackle problems that had been building up for decades.  And the central problem in our economy that had been building up for decades is the fact that while folks at the top did very well, ordinary workers were seeing their wages and their incomes flat-lining.

And so the biggest challenge America continues to have is making sure that everybody in this new economy is participating, everybody who works hard is getting paid a decent wage with decent benefits, everybody has some basic economic security, and that the incredible productivity and wealth and innovation that has been a hallmark of the American economy is broadly based.  

Wages need to rise more quickly.  We need jobs to offer the kind of pay and benefits that let people raise a family.  And in order to do that, workers need a voice.  They need the voice and the leverage that guarantees this kind of middle-class security.  
And that’s true now more than ever, during this time of rapid economic change.  In recent years, we’ve seen an explosion of American innovation in the workforce.  And because of technology, people are empowered and employers are empowered to create value and services in new ways.  

We’ve got folks who are getting a paycheck driving for Uber or Lyft; people who are cleaning other people’s houses through Handy; offering their skills on TaskRabbit.  And so there’s flexibility and autonomy and opportunity for workers.  And millennials love working their phones much quicker than I can.  (Laughter.)  And all this is promising.  But if the combination of globalization and automation undermines the capacity of the ordinary worker and the ordinary family to be able to support themselves, if employers are able to use these factors to weaken workers’ voices and give them a take-it-or-leave-it deal in which they don't have a chance to ever save for the kind of retirement they're looking for, if we don't refashion the social compact so that workers are able to be rewarded properly for the labor that they put in -- people like Terrence -- then we're going to have problems.

And it’s not just going to be a problem for our politics -- creating resentment and anxiety -- it’s going be a problem for our economy because the history shows that when we do best as an economy it’s when workers have money in their pockets and they're able to buy goods and services.  And they, in turn, create new demand, and create new opportunity, and create the kinds of markets that businesses can then take advantage of.  That's just a fact.

So we’ve got to make sure that as we continue to move forward, both in this new “on demand” economy and in the traditional economy as a whole, hard work guarantees some security.  And that's what this summit is about -– making sure that, as our economy continues to evolve, working Americans don’t get lost in the shuffle.  They can come together and they can win.  

And we can do this.  We’ve done it before.  There was a time when we shifted from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy.  And as we did, we made some adjustments to our arrangements.  We said, you know what, we’re going to offer everybody a free public education.  We put together the New Deal, put in place systems like Social Security so that people had some basic protections in their golden years.  We put together labor laws that allowed for collective bargaining, and banned child labor, and allowed people to raise their voices and have some leverage in seeking a living wage. 

Labor unions were often the driving force for progress.  The 40-hour workweek, overtime pay, health insurance, retirement plans.  The middle class itself was built on a union label.  (Applause.)  And that middle class that was built was the engine of our prosperity.  And people at the top were doing just fine during these periods.  We had a lot of wealth.  The top 1 percent, the top 10 percent still claimed a much larger share of income and wealth than everybody else, but it was in the context of a dynamic economy where wages and incomes were rising and most Americans felt stable and secure.  The future looked brighter than the past.

Now, the economy is changing again.  Technology has made it easier for companies to do more with less.  They have world markets and the capacity to shift operations along the global supply chain.  

Special interests argued that worker protections -- including unions themselves -- were to blame for middle-class struggles, and, unfortunately, too many folks bought into that.  So union enrollment dropped precipitously.  Oftentimes companies became more sophisticated about keeping out unions.  Workers, fearing that they might lose their job to off-shoring or to moving down to a right-to-work state, felt less confident about negotiations.  

Our culture as a whole started somehow extolling greed is good, instead of, how do we work together to create a good society for everybody.  Jobs, as a consequence, began paying less, offering fewer benefits.  And in recent years, we’ve seen more companies cut costs by hiring contractors and “permatemps”  -- workers who are laboring side-by-side with full-time employees but don’t earn the same pay and benefits and job security.  That’s a bad phrase -- permatemps.    

The bottom line is, as union membership has fallen, inequality has risen.  Union membership today is as low as it’s been in about 80 years, since the ‘30s.  And I believe that when folks attack unions, they’re attacking the middle class.  They’re attacking cops, firefighters, teachers, nurses, service workers, public servants, auto workers, plumbers, Americans who keep our streets safe and clean, who prepare our food, who clean up after us, who care for our aging parents.  

And so, in today’s economy, we should be making it easier, not harder, for folks to join a union.  We should be strengthening our labor laws, not rolling them back.  (Applause.) And for contractors or workers who can’t join unions, we should be finding new avenues for them to join together and advocate for themselves as well.  

There’s a saying that I think Lee Saunders -- where is Lee? He’s in here somewhere.  There he is, right next to Rich over there.  He likes to quote this -- “If you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.”  (Laughter.)  So we’ve got to get more working Americans to the table.  But in order to do that, we have to acknowledge that you can’t just keep on doing the same things thinking you’re going to get a different outcome.  

So part of the goal of this summit is to think creatively about how do we have a growing movement around the country to empower workers, to give them a sense of possibility.  And we’re seeing some of that happening here, some of the people who are represented here.  Workers are organizing online at sites like Coworker.org to fight for new protections.  Fast-food workers like Terrence are organizing for a raise -- with the support of the labor movement, and they’ve scored major victories in New York and L.A.  We’ve got the National Domestic Workers Alliance  -- an organization of caregivers and housekeepers and nannies -- who teamed up with Care.com to make sure these workers got the support that they deserve.  It’s called The Fair Care Pledge -- and employers who take the pledge voluntarily agree to pay a fair wage, and set a clear example and provide for paid time off.  

So we’ve got to look for new tools to bring people together, because in today’s economy, it’s not always going to be a situation where you just have one plants and one worker and one organizing drive; it’s going to be workers who are not always on a single site.  And we’ve got to find ways to make sure that they can express their solidarity in new ways.  And that’s where technology actually can help in the same ways that in the past sometimes it’s hindered.

And then we need to engage businesses to lead the way, as well, because there are businesses out there who are taking the high road and enlist their employees as partners in their shared future, and understand that if they’re investing in their employees and making them partners, that they’ll actually do better, not worse.  They’ll do better for shareholders.  They’ll do better for the community.  They’ll do better for America.  

So you got New Belgium Brewing that opens up its books and its strategic decision-making process to employees -- and they also make really good beer.  (Laughter.)  Kaiser Permanente works with 28 different unions to provide good pay and benefits, but also educational programs, and avenues for employees to help improve quality and care throughout the company -- which is why they're considered one of the premier health organizations in the country.  Cumberland Farms convenience stores connects employees and leadership through apps and online platforms, and that leads to more input from employees and higher retention rates and better service.  

So there are good things happening in America.  But the question is:  How do we scale up?  How do we draw best practices and start changing mindsets?  How do we help working folks and their families get ahead?

So we’re here today to think about where do we go next.  We’ve got to ask ourselves:  What does the next generation of American jobs look like?  How do we make sure those jobs reward hard work?  At a time of shrinking union membership, but a growing number of digital tools for organizing, how do we make sure everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead?  

And how do we change public attitudes so that people who are frustrated feel empowered and not isolated?  I think this is very important.  We're entering into political season -- and I won’t make a big commentary on all of that.  Obviously, I’m a proud Democrat and I think we have better answers on a lot of these questions.  But I will say this.  The fear, the apprehension that can express itself in all kinds of ways -- anti-immigration sentiment, resentment towards people who don't look exactly like you do, some of the anger that can express itself in not very productive economic policies -- a lot of that is fed by just people feeling anxious about their futures, and feeling alone and feeling like they’ve got no control and that nobody is listening. 

And so part of what we’ve got to do is to tap into people who are frustrated about their job paying so little, people who are frustrated about industries that used to be in their town leaving, rightly frustrated about how hard it is to save for retirement, rightly frustrated about the fact that they can be replaced at any time with very little protections -- and make sure that they understand there’s a positive way to deal with these issues that will actually produce and deliver change, and make things better -- not just for them, but for all workers.  We got to help people feel connected and not isolated, and hopeful, not just fearful.

And that requires that we do some self-examination about how we approach these problems.  And I’ll be honest with you -- I’ve had conversations with our union leadership about this -- you've got a whole millennial generation who knows they're not getting a good deal in the workplace but don't consider joining unions, in part because the laws have been set up to make so hard to unionize, but also in part because they don't live in a town where everybody is working in the same plant and there’s a tradition of going to the assembly hall, and they haven’t seen their parents or grandparents for generations participating in joining in same ways.  And they connect, but they connect in different ways.  And we’ve got to adapt to that -- try to find new ways of bringing people in.

So that's why you're all here today to come up with some answers.  I’ve got ideas, but this is a hard problem and it’s going to require creativity and effort from all of us.  And we’ve got leaders from labor, business, and government; we got some of the brightest minds in organizing and economics; and we’ve got folks like Terrence and his mom, Joann, some of the hardest working Americans in the country.  So you are in charge for the day.  I’m eager to hear your ideas and your solutions.  I know there are going to be some breakout sessions. 

I’m going to come back and have a town hall and hopefully be able to hear some of the discussion that's been taking place.  But I do want to start the discussion by just offering a set of common-sense principles for what it means to work in America.  

First -- if you work hard in America, you should earn enough money to support your family.  (Applause.)  And if you’re working two jobs, like Terrence, then your family should never have to go to bed hungry.  (Applause.)

Second -- if you work hard in America, you should earn decent benefits.  And that means access to the two bedrock sources of lifelong security, and that is affordable health coverage and retirement savings.  (Applause.) 

Third -- if you work hard in America, you have the right to a safe workplace.  And if you get hurt on the job, or become disabled or unemployed, you should still be able to keep food on the table.  (Applause.)

Fourth -- if you work hard in America, you should be able to take care of those you love, which means having sick leave and parental leave and affordable child care, and predictable schedules that give your family some stability.  (Applause.)

Fifth -- if you work hard in America, you should have a pathway to the education and training you need to grow your skills and earn raises and promotions and the chance to get ahead.  (Applause.)

And finally, if you work hard in America, you should have the freedom to decide for yourself -- without fear or interference -- if you want to join with others to advocate for yourself in the workplace, whether that’s through a union or any other means.  And these are core principles that helped build this country.  (Applause.)

So I’m sure there are going to be a lot of ideas coming out of these discussions, but these are the guideposts that we need to stay focused on:  Good pay; benefits; workplace safety; work-family balance; skills training; the freedom to organize.  That’s what unions secured for us.  That’s what we have to secure for the next generation of workers.

We’ve done a lot of work on these issues -- extending overtime protections, helping workers collect fair pay that they’ve earned, ensuring paid sick leave for federal contractors. Seventeen states and 30 cities and counties so far have answered my call to raise the minimum wage.  

There are few policies that have done more to provide Americans with financial security than Obamacare.  Because insurance plans on the new federal marketplace are affordable and portable, folks now have the power and peace of mind to switch jobs, or start a new business, or make a living in the on-demand economy without worrying about whether they’re going to get sick. 

So we’re going to continue to do everything in our power to help working families get ahead.  And we’re going to still have to worry about short-term politics even as we try to shift long-term perspectives here.  Congress has to do its job right now and pass a budget that strengthens protections for America’s workers, and invests in the education and job training that prepares our workforce for the future.  And they need to strengthen paid leave and expanded child care, and raise the minimum wage for Americans across this country.  (Applause.)  

They should pass the WAGE Act -- a bill that cracks down on employers who violate labor laws, and that makes it easier for workers to organize.  (Applause.)

And I’ll end on this point.  You can’t wait for Congress.  (Laughter.)  No, no, I’m just saying.  We’ve got incredible champions like Nancy Pelosi and members of Congress who are here, but this is a fight on the ground.  We’ve got to change an attitude and mindset that says there’s nothing we can do, or giving workers more voice means inefficiency and we won’t be competitive, or suggests that there’s a contradiction between economic growth and decent wages, or suggests that we should have a race to the bottom with other countries, or suggests that somehow the current arrangements in which a growing amount of what we produce in this country going to the top .001 percent is in the natural order of things and is somehow fair and just.

Those are attitudes that we have to change.  And that’s going to happen on the ground.  And that will then reflect itself in politics, and that will reflect itself in new laws being passed.

But we’ve got to give people examples and models, and work where we can to make a difference where we can.  And that will give people confidence and hope, and can start triggering the kind of broader movement that channels people’s anxieties and frustrations in ways that are good for our future.  

So I want to hear from you about the challenges you’re facing right now, the successes you’ve earned, the ideas you have to strengthen workers’ voices across the country.  I will come back later this afternoon.  I don’t expect you to come up with all the answers today, but I do want to make sure we’re asking the right questions and that we produce a set of relationships and work streams to really get this going.  

If we do that, then we’re going to be able to keep America a place where, when you work hard, you can get ahead, and more importantly, you can see your kids and your grandkids get ahead.

Thanks, everybody.  I’ll see you this afternoon.  (Applause.)

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, it is a great honor to have a great friend of the United States, President Gauck, visit the Oval Office.  It gives me an opportunity to repay the hospitality that the President extended to me during one of my visits to Germany.
  
Although it’s well-known in Germany, for American audiences, some people may not be aware of the President’s extraordinary life and the role that he’s played in creating a modern, unified, democratic and peaceful Germany.  As a pastor and a democratic activist in Eastern Germany, he played an important role in giving voice to the aspirations of all those who sought a unified Germany that reflected the values that we now see in that great country.

And as Germany recently marked an important milestone in reunification, it’s a great reminder that not only was reunification important for Germany, but it was important for Europe, it was important for the transatlantic relationship, and it was important for the world.

Germany obviously is one of our strongest allies.  And the President continues to give voice to the importance of the U.S.-German relationship, to the values of tolerance and democracy and human rights and freedom that are so important to both of our countries.  On a wide range of international issues -- from the tragic situation in Syria and the need for a humane response to the refugee crisis, to a peaceful resolution that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon -- the President’s voice has been clear in helping Germany make its mark on the world’s stage and serve as an incredibly important partner for us.

And I think his travel itinerary here in the United States, visiting Philadelphia and seeing the Liberty Bell, visits here to the King Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial, I think are indicative of the shared values, both democratic and religious and humanist, that are so important to the President, important to Germany, and important to the American people.

So we welcome him.  I look forward to an excellent discussion about how we can further deepen our already extraordinarily strong ties, and deeply appreciate the work that he’s done on behalf of Germany and on behalf of the world.

PRESIDENT GAUCK:  (As interpreted.)  Mr. President, I would like to thank you very much for having invited me.  Your invitation reaches me at the age -- at a time where I’ve turned 75.  And in that life span of mine, the United States of America have twice expressed their strong support for a cooperative development of Germany, and thus have had a positive influence on German development.

And my visit has to be viewed in a broader historical context.  Seventy years ago, Germany suffered a vast defeat, a defeat that then turned into a liberation for the country.  Many Americans gave their lives at that time in order to bring out that liberation.  Twenty-five years ago, my country became reunited.  Americans like the then-President George W. Bush Senior and other Americans have expressed their strong support firmly and early on in ensuring Germany became united.  One cannot but express one’s gratitude for that fact.  And this is how I want my visit to be understood.

It is in this context that you have mentioned the places I’ve had the pleasure to visit during my visit here.  In Philadelphia, I went to see the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.  I went to the room in which important documents of importance for the integrity of the United States of America -- freedom for everyone, that is -- a nation of liberty on display. 
 
I went to visit the Lincoln Memorial to remember Martin Luther King, and thus I expect that, above and beyond the topics that we will discuss today and that we need to discuss because they are of importance and affect us these days -- my visit is also to be understood as kind of pilgrimage to the birthplace of a country that embodies very important concepts and ideas -- ideas that are important for the American people, but also for the history of mankind.

Thus, I have the expectations that, as I said, of course, we are going to talk about topical issues, but we will also have the opportunity to address the odd problem in that context, but I also want to do that, expressing my full awareness of the fact that relations between our countries and peoples are firmly based on a solid, longstanding foundation.

Mr. President, I am very grateful that you have raised a topic that has turned to a burning issue these days, one of the major problems on our agenda -- that is, the present situation in Syria, which is very complicated and complex indeed.  We are not yet in a position where we could claim that we have found the appropriate response to this problem and this crisis, and as the crisis unfolds, we are faced with a situation that faces another difficult situation for us, and that is the great influx of a great number of refugees, of people who are fearing for their lives and thus are leaving their home country.

Now, Germany, because of its history, is a country that shows great readiness to allow these people into its country to offer asylum for these people in dire need.  And this is why this issue has very much moved into the focus of political debate and to the top of Germany’s or Europe’s political agenda these days. 
 
We are much aware of the fact that this is a major humanitarian challenge that we have to address.  And my hope would be, my wish would be that a realization that that awareness does not only exist in Europe, but it’s also something that is recognized in the United States of America.  And I also have the sincere hope and wish that we may succeed in finding a solution on the one hand for these people who are fleeing their country, but also a solution that will allow us to tackle the problem at its root causes. 

We are very close here, Mr. President.  Every side is trying to do its bit.  And I’m very grateful for the fact.

It is in this sense that I would like to convey the heartfelt greetings of the Federal Chancellor to you, Mr. President.  At the same time, I would like to thank you for the very kind words you have found as regards my personal life and myself as a person.

I still remember very fondly the joy felt by the German people when you for the first time came to pay a visit to my country.  And that feeling of openness and joy was a feeling that was addressed to you, Mr. President, but it was also German hearts going out to the American people and to the Nobel Peace Laureate, Barack Obama.  And I think that that is an illustration of the fact that, despite the disagreements and misunderstandings that occur every once in a while -- and I think that is only natural, in a way, amongst partners -- we are very close.  We are cooperating closely.  We share common values.  And I would wish to underline this here now once again.  

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Thank you very much, everybody.

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yesterday we announced a new trade agreement across the Asia Pacific region that reflects American values and gives our working families and American businesses a fair shot, creates a level playing field.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership took five years to negotiate, and I wanted to get the best possible deal done for American workers and American businesses, and that is what we have achieved.  

This agreement makes us more competitive by eliminating about 18,000 taxes, tariffs that are placed on America’s products in these other countries.  Just to give you a couple examples, Japan puts a 38-percent tax on American beef before it ever reaches market.  Malaysia currently puts a 30-percent tax on American auto parts.  Vietnam puts a tax of as much as 70 percent on every car American automakers sell in Vietnam. 

Under this agreement, all those foreign taxes will fall.  Most of them will fall to zero.  So we are knocking down barriers that are currently preventing American businesses from selling in these countries and are preventing American workers from benefitting from those sales to the fastest-growing, most dynamic region in the world.

This agreement opens up new markets for goods that are made in America.  Last year, we exported more than $2 trillion worth of goods and services, which supported about 11.7 million American jobs.  That’s the fifth straight year that we had set an export record.  But when 95 percent of the world’s markets are outside of our borders, we’ve got to do even better than that, particularly at a time when our economy is actually doing better than a lot of other countries and they want to sell stuff here.  We’ve got to make sure that we’re able to sell stuff over there.

With this trade agreement, which spans nearly 40 percent of the global economy, we’re going to be able to sell more products, more services, American agriculture, American manufacturing -- we’re going to be able to get those to markets, and American companies that produce here in the United States are not going to be disadvantaged relative to these markets.

Keep in mind that when there are high barriers in these countries, oftentimes that’s when a lot of American companies feel compelled -- if we want to reach those markets, we’ve got to go produce over there.  If the tariffs are down, if the taxes are down on goods made in America, that means U.S. companies that are investing here are able to sell over there without a disadvantage.  That’s what American leadership looks like in the 21st century.  That’s why this agreement also sets high standards for one of the fastest-growing regions of the world.

This agreement has the strongest labor standards of any trade agreement in history, including setting fair hours, prohibiting child labor, prohibiting forced labor.  It includes the highest environmental standards in history, and prevents overfishing, and makes sure that wildlife trafficking isn’t decimating wildlife that are a world treasure.

And so unlike past agreements, these standards -- high standards around labor and environment -- are actually enforceable.  If countries aren’t abiding by them, then they don’t get the benefits of selling to the United States under the terms of this agreement.  And, under this agreement, we, rather than countries like China, are writing the rules for the global economy.  

So I’ve said repeatedly that I would only sign an agreement and present an agreement to Congress if I could be absolutely certain that it was good for American workers and good for American businesses, good for American farmers and good for American ranchers, and good for American manufacturers.  We have met that standard in this agreement.

So this week marks an important step forward, but there’s going to be a long, healthy process of discussion and consultation and debate before this ever comes to an actual vote.  And we committed properly that we would post this agreement, every crossed t and dotted i, on a website so that everybody is going to be able to look at it.  We are going to be talking not just to members of Congress, but the American public and various constituencies, and governors, and mayors who are represented here about why this is good for their communities.

And so we’re going to have months before this actually comes up for a vote.  People are going to have plenty of time to go over it.  I suspect that there will be some misinformation that is propagated around this, as there usually is in these debates.  But I’m also confident that the case to be made for why this is good for America is sufficiently strong; that ultimately we’re going to get this done, and it will be an enormous achievement for us to be able to make sure that 40 percent of the world’s economy is operating under rules that don’t hurt us, but instead help make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a fair shot, and that made in America, those products and services can be sold in places where there’s going to be significant demand.

So I want to thank everybody around this table.  This is a diverse constituency.  A lot of different groups are represented here.  We want to thank all of them for their work in getting us to this point, and now helping us get across the finish line.

Thank you very much, everybody.

THE PRESIDENT:   Thank you.  Craig, thanks for that introduction, but more importantly, thank you for the outstanding work that you and your team do all across the country every single day.  For those of you who know Craig, you know that he is cool under pressure, no doubt because he got his start -- started his career as a firefighter.  I want to thank Congressman Steny Hoyer, Fire Administrator Ernest Mitchell, Chief Dennis Compton, and everybody at the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation for bringing us together here today.  And most especially, I want to say how honored I am to be with the families of the fallen, and express the gratitude of the nation for the sacrifices that you and your families have made on behalf of others.

Scripture tells us, “As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.”  Employ it in serving one another.  Every single day, across our country, men and women leave their homes and their families so they might save the lives of people that they’ve never met.  They are good stewards -- serving their neighbors, their communities, our nation with courage, and fortitude and strength.  We can never repay them fully for their sacrifices. 

But today, we gather to honor 87 brave firefighters who gave their lives in service to us all.  Our prayers are with their families, many of whom honor us with their presence today.  You remember them as moms and dads, siblings and spouses, friends and neighbors.  Today, we remember them and salute them as the heroes that they were.

It’s hard to think of a more selfless profession than firefighting.  There’s a reason why firefighting occupies a special place in our imaginations; why little boys and increasingly little girls say, I want to be a fireman, I want to a firefighter.  They understand instinctually that there’s something special about it.  Imagine what it takes to put on that heavy coat, and that helmet, and override the natural human instinct for self-preservation, and run into danger as others are running away; to literally walk through fire knowing that you might never make it out because you’re trying to save people that are strangers.

And yet, the fallen that we honor today would probably have said that they were just ordinary Americans who were doing work they believed in, carrying on a tradition as old as America itself.  There’s a humility that seems to be part of being a firefighter.  From rural communities to inner cities, those we honor today lived a fundamental principle that binds us all as Americans -- that I am my brother’s keeper, I am my sister’s keeper, that we look out for one another, that there’s something bigger than each of us individually that we have to be true to.

We honor men like Michael Garrett of West Virginia.  Mikey, as he was known, started out as a junior firefighter at the age of 16, became an EMT by 18, was on his way to graduating with an associate degree in emergency services.  His mom, Faith, says Mikey was always smiling, always a practical joker -- if you turned around, your cell phone would be in the pool.  And he was always the guy you could call on in a pinch.  No matter how busy he was -- between school and work and being an EMT instructor himself -- he’d be there to help.

And in February of last year, Mikey was pulling a seriously injured utility worker out of harm’s way when a cell tower came crashing down.  And he was only 28 years old -- 28 years old.  He’s survived by Faith, his dad Dale, his four siblings.  And he will always be remembered by his community as a good man devoted to helping others -- that’s who he was.  And he typifies what it means to be a firefighter and to serve others.  

That’s who Kevin Bell was, too.  Kevin was that rare combination of full-time firefighter and part-time DJ.  His wife, Wayette, says that the day he graduated from the fire academy in Connecticut was one of the happiest days of his life.  And he truly loved his work, and his kindness and generosity were widely known.  And like so many firefighters, he never talked about his heroic actions.  His daughter, Raquel, says that she would later hear from those he had helped, above and beyond the call of duty.  The friend he had assisted after a car accident.  The classmate he drove to the hospital after an epileptic seizure. 

Last October, Kevin gave his life battling a house fire.  He is survived by Wayette, and Raquel, his parents, and his siblings.  Because of the role model Kevin was, there are African-American kids in his Hartford neighborhood who want to be firefighters just like him.  And one day, they’ll be able to go to work in the Kevin Lamont Bell Fire Station.

We honor heroes like Malcolm Jenkins of Louisville, Kentucky.  Malcolm was the “go-to-guy” in the firehouse; no task was too big or too small.  He was the guy who could fix anything, which his wife Sharon says taught his three daughters an important lesson:  Marry a man who can fix everything that you can break.  (Laughter.) 

Malcolm was a farmer when, many years ago, the county put out the call for volunteer firefighters.  He rose to become a major, and helped develop the Kentucky Regional Fire Training Academy, which has trained hundreds of firefighters to serve their communities.  Last October, Malcolm succumbed to a heart attack.  And today, in Malcolm Jenkins, we remember not just a great firefighter, but a loving son, husband, father, grandfather, and friend.

These are the kinds of individuals we honor today.  And even as we honor these 87 heroes, we know that their work is carried on by firefighters all across our nation -- by so many of you --with that same bravery, and that same dedication, that same sense of duty, that same humility, that same love of country. 

In recent years, you’ve battled some of the most severe wildfire seasons in American history.  So far this year, nearly 50,000 wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres -- an area larger than the entire state of Maryland.  At the season’s peak, 32,000 firefighters were battling blazes from California to North Carolina.  Thirteen have lost their lives.  And today, we honor them as well.  And we reaffirm that, as a nation, we must work to prevent fires, and we must give firefighters the equipment and the support that they need to get the job done and to come home safe -- that’s what we owe every one of you.  (Applause.) 

And finally, this memorial also pays tribute to names that do not appear on this wall.  It’s a testament to you, the families of these individuals.  The families who stand alongside every firefighter across this nation.  Because the brotherhood of firefighting doesn’t stop at the firehouse door.  It extends to every community across our country -- to every mom and dad, every spouse, every child who waits for their loved one to come home at the end of a shift.  All of you are united by an unbreakable bond of strength and sacrifice.  This is your family, too.

For the families of the fallen, we know that words alone can’t ease the pain of your loss.  But perhaps it helps a little bit to know that the American people stand with you in honoring your loved ones.  We admire them.  We cherish the work that they do.  We hold you in our hearts, today and always.  We offer you our deepest condolences, and our prayers, and our eternal gratitude. 

These are extraordinary people that we honor here today.  They’re extraordinary Americans.  They set an example for us all.  May God bless these fallen heroes.  May he watch over their families and all who protect us.  May their shining example inspire us all in our own lives -- “As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.” 

Thank you.  (Applause.)

WASHINGTON, DC — In this week's address, the President emphasized that we need to do everything we can to strengthen economic growth and job creation.  This week, despite the fact that more than half of Republicans in Congress voted to shut down the government for the second time in two years, Congress managed to pass a last-minute bill to keep the government open for another ten weeks.  That means that in December, we could face yet another Republican threat to shut down the government.  The President emphasized that Congress needs to stop kicking the can down the road and do its job.  He stressed that Republicans and Democrats need to work together to pass a budget that fully funds the government and reverses the harmful sequestration cuts, and vowed that he would not sign another shortsighted spending bill like the one Congress sent him this past week.

Hi, everybody.  Yesterday, we learned that our businesses created another 118,000 new jobs in September.  That makes 67 straight months of job creation, and 13.2 million new jobs in all. 

But we would be doing even better if we didn’t have to keep dealing with crises in Congress every few months.  And especially at a time when the global economy is softening, our own growth could slow if Congress doesn’t do away with harmful austerity measures.

Now, on Wednesday, more than half of Republicans in Congress voted to shut down the government for the second time in two years.  Fortunately, there were enough votes in both parties to pass a last-minute bill to keep the government open for another ten weeks.  Unfortunately, that gimmick only sets up another shutdown threat two weeks before Christmas.

Look, that’s not the way America should operate.  It just kicks the can down the road without solving any problems or doing any long-term planning for the future.  And that’s why I will not sign another shortsighted, short-term spending bill like the one Congress sent me this week. 

Here’s why.  A few years ago, both parties agreed to put in place harmful, automatic cuts that make no distinction between spending we don’t need and spending we do.  Those cuts have actually kept our economy from growing faster.  Even worse, they’re actually undermining the middle class. 

Here’s one example.  If we don’t undo these mindless cuts, then next year, we’ll be funding our kids’ education at the same levels per pupil we did in the year 2000.  Compared to my budget, that would be like cutting federal funding for 4,500 schools, 17,500 teachers and aides, 1.9 million students. 

That’s not good for our kids or our economy.  It’s a prescription for American decline.  And it shouldn’t happen.  We should invest in things like education today, or we’ll pay the price tomorrow.

Congress should do its job, stop kicking the can down the road, and pass a serious budget rather than flirt with another shutdown.  A serious budget is one that keeps America strong through our military, our law enforcement; that keeps America generous through caring for our veterans and our seniors; that keeps America competitive by educating our kids and our workers.

That’s what I want to work with serious people in both parties to achieve.  Because that’s how we’ll build on the progress of 13 million new jobs, and help the middle class get ahead.

Thanks everybody, and have a great weekend.

THE PRESIDENT:  I'm going to take a couple of questions from the press.  But first, a few additional pieces of business.

First of all, we learned today that our businesses created another 118,000 new jobs in September, which means that we now have had 67 straight months of job creation; 13.2 million new jobs in all -- and an unemployment rate that has fallen from a high of 10 percent down to 5.1 percent.  These long-term trends are obviously good news, particularly for every American waking up each morning and heading off to a new job.

But we would be doing even better if we didn’t have to keep on dealing with unnecessary crises in Congress every few months. And this is especially important right now, because although the American economy has been chugging along at a steady pace, much of the global economy is softening.  We’ve seen an impact on our exports, which was a major driver of growth for us particularly at the beginning of the recovery.  And so our own growth could slow if Congress does not do away with some of the counterproductive austerity measures that they have put in place, and if Congress does not avoid the kind of manufactured crises that shatter consumer confidence and could disrupt an already skittish global economy. 

On Wednesday, more than half of Republicans voted to shut down the government for the second time in two years.  The good news is that there were enough votes in both parties to pass a last-minute bill to keep the government open and operating for another 10 weeks before we can get a more long-term solution.  But keep in mind that gimmick only sets up another potential manufactured crisis just two weeks before Christmas. 

And I’ve said this before, I want to repeat it -- this is not the way the United States should be operating.

Oftentimes I hear from folks up on Capitol Hill, “the need for American leadership,” “the need for America to be number one.”  Well, you know what, around the globe, part of what makes us a leader is when we govern effectively and we keep our own house in order, and we pass budgets, and we can engage in long-term planning, and we can invest in the things that are important for the future.  That’s U.S. leadership. 

When we fail to do that, we diminish U.S. leadership.  It’s not how we are supposed to operate.  And we can’t just keep on kicking down the road without solving any problems or doing any long-term planning for the future.  That’s true for our military; that’s true for our domestic programs.  The American people, American families deserve better.  And we can grow faster and the economy can improve if Congress acts with dispatch.  It will get worse if they don't. 

That’s why I want to be very clear:  I will not sign another shortsighted spending bill like the one Congress sent me this week.  We purchased ourselves 10 additional weeks; we need to use them effectively.

Keep in mind that a few years ago, both parties put in place harmful automatic cuts that make no distinction between spending we don’t need and spending we do.  We can revisit the history of how that happened -- I have some rather grim memories of it.  But the notion was that even as we were bringing down the deficit, we would come up with a sustainable, smart, long-term approach to investing in the things that we need.  That didn't happen.  And so now these cuts that have been maintained have been keeping our economy from growing faster.  It’s time to undo them.  If we don’t, then we will have to fund our economic and national security priorities in 2016 at the same levels that we did in 2006.

Now, understand, during that decade, between 2006 and 2016, our economy has grown by 12 percent.  Our population has grown by 8 percent.  New threats have emerged; new opportunities have appeared.  We can’t fund our country the way we did 10 years ago because we have greater demands -- with an aging population, with kids who need schools, with roads that need to be fixed, with a military on which we are placing extraordinary demands.

And we can’t cut our way to prosperity.  Other countries have tried it and it has not worked.  We’ve grown faster than they have because we did not pursue these blind, unthinking cuts to necessary investments for our growth.  And by the way, because we’ve grown faster than them, we’ve brought our deficits down faster than they have. 

I want to repeat this because the public apparently never believes it.  Since I took office, we’ve cut our deficits by two-thirds.  The deficit has not been going up; it has been coming down -- precipitously.  We’ve cut our deficits by two-thirds.  They’re below the average deficits over the past 40 years.

So the bottom line is, Congress has to do its job.  It can't flirt with another shutdown.  It should pass a serious budget.  And if they do, and get rid of some of these mindless cuts, even as we're still prudent about maintaining the spending that we need but not spending we don't need and is not working, their own non-partisan budget office estimates we’re going to add an extra half-million jobs to our economy next year alone.  We can immediately put half a million more people back to work if we just have a more sensible budget. 

And in these negotiations, nobody is going to get everything they want.  We have to work together, though, even if we disagree, in order to do the people’s business.  At some point we have to want to govern, and not just play politics or play to various political bases.  At some point, we need to pass bills so that we can rebuild our roads, and keep our kids learning, and our military strong, and help people prepare for and recover from disasters.  That is Congress’s most basic job.  That’s what our government is supposed to do -- serve the American people.

So with that, let me take some questions.  And I’ll start with Julie Pace of AP. 

Hang in there, kids.  (Laughter.)

Q    It will be over soon.  Thank you, Mr. President.  There have been several developments in Syria that I wanted to ask you about, starting with Russia’s involvement.  You met with President Putin earlier this week, and I wonder if you think he was honest with you about his intentions in Syria.  If Russia is targeting groups beyond the Islamic State, including U.S.-aligned groups, does the U.S. military have an obligation to protect them?  And on the situation in Syria more broadly, there have obviously been failures in the U.S. train-and-equip program.  Do you believe that that program can be fixed or do you have to look at other options?  Would you, in particular, be willing to reconsider a no-fly zone, which several presidential candidates, including your former Secretary of State, are now calling for?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first and foremost, let’s understand what’s happening in Syria and how we got here.  What started off as peaceful protests against Assad, the president, evolved into a civil war because Assad met those protests with unimaginable brutality.  And so this is not a conflict between the United States and any party in Syria; this is a conflict between the Syrian people and a brutal, ruthless dictator.

Point number two is that the reason Assad is still in power is because Russia and Iran have supported him throughout this process.  And in that sense, what Russia is doing now is not particularly different from what they had been doing in the past -- they’re just more overt about it.  They’ve been propping up a regime that is rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Syrian population because they’ve seen that he has been willing to drop barrel bombs on children and on villages indiscriminately, and has been more concerned about clinging to power than the state of his country.

So in my discussions with President Putin, I was very clear that the only way to solve the problem in Syria is to have a political transition that is inclusive -- that keeps the state intact, that keeps the military intact, that maintains cohesion, but that is inclusive -- and the only way to accomplish that is for Mr. Assad to transition, because you cannot rehabilitate him in the eyes of Syrians.  This is not a judgment I’m making; it is a judgment that the overwhelming majority of Syrians make.

And I said to Mr. Putin that I’d be prepared to work with him if he is willing to broker with his partners, Mr. Assad and Iran, a political transition -- we can bring the rest of the world community to a brokered solution -- but that a military solution alone, an attempt by Russia and Iran to prop up Assad and try to pacify the population is just going to get them stuck in a quagmire.  And it won’t work.  And they will be there for a while if they don’t take a different course.

I also said to him that it is true that the United States and Russia and the entire world have a common interest in destroying ISIL.  But what was very clear -- and regardless of what Mr. Putin said -- was that he doesn’t distinguish between ISIL and a moderate Sunni opposition that wants to see Mr. Assad go.  From their perspective, they’re all terrorists.  And that’s a recipe for disaster, and it’s one that I reject.

So where we are now is that we are having technical conversations about de-confliction so that we’re not seeing U.S. and American firefights in the air.  But beyond that, we’re very clear in sticking to our belief and our policy that the problem here is Assad and the brutality that he has inflicted on the Syrian people, and that it has to stop.  And in order for it to stop, we’re prepared to work with all the parties concerned.  But we are not going to cooperate with a Russian campaign to simply try to destroy anybody who is disgusted and fed up with Mr. Assad’s behavior.

Keep in mind also, from a practical perspective, the moderate opposition in Syria is one that if we’re ever going to have to have a political transition, we need.  And the Russian policy is driving those folks underground or creating a situation in which they are de-capacitated, and it’s only strengthening ISIL.  And that’s not good for anybody.

In terms of our support of opposition groups inside of Syria, I made very clear early on that the United States couldn’t impose a military solution on Syria either, but that it was in our interest to make sure that we were engaged with moderate opposition inside of Syria because eventually Syria will fall, the Assad regime will fall, and we have to have somebody who we’re working with that we can help pick up the pieces and stitch back together a cohesive, coherent country.  And so we will continue to support them.

The training-and-equip program was a specific initiative by the Defense Department to see if we could get some of that moderate opposition to focus attention on ISIL in the eastern portion of the country.  And I’m the first one to acknowledge it has not worked the way it was supposed to, Julie.  And I think that the Department of Defense would say the same thing.  And part of the reason, frankly, is because when we tried to get them to just focus on ISIL, the response we’d get back is, how can we focus on ISIL when every single day we’re having barrel bombs and attacks from the regime?  And so it’s been hard to get them to reprioritize, looking east, when they’ve got bombs coming at them from the west.

So what we’re doing with the train-and-equip is looking at where we have had success -- for example, working with some of the Kurdish community in the east that pushed ISIL out -- seeing if we can build on that.  But what we're also going to continue to do is to have contacts with and work with opposition that, rightly, believes that in the absence of some change of government inside of Syria we're going to continue to see civil war, and that is going to turbocharge ISIL recruitment and jihadist recruitment, and we're going to continue to have problems.

Now, last point I just want to make about this -- because sometimes the conversation here in the Beltway differs from the conversation internationally.  Mr. Putin had to go into Syria not out of strength but out of weakness, because his client, Mr. Assad, was crumbling.  And it was insufficient for him simply to send them arms and money; now he’s got to put in his own planes and his own pilots.  And the notion that he put forward a plan and that somehow the international community sees that as viable because there is a vacuum there -- I didn't see, after he made that speech in the United Nations, suddenly the 60-nation coalition that we have start lining up behind him. 

Iran and Assad make up Mr. Putin’s coalition at the moment. The rest of the world makes up ours.  So I don't think people are fooled by the current strategy.  It does not mean that we could not see Mr. Putin begin to recognize that it is in their interest to broker a political settlement.  And as I said in New York, we're prepared to work with the Russians and the Iranians, as well as our partners who are part of the anti-ISIL coalition to come up with that political transition.  And nobody pretends that it’s going to be easy, but I think it is still possible.  And so we will maintain lines of communication. 

But we are not going to be able to get those negotiations going if there is not a recognition that there’s got to be a change in government.  We're not going to go back to the status quo ante.  And the kinds of airstrikes against moderate opposition that Russia is engaging in is going to be counterproductive.  It’s going to move us farther away rather than towards the ultimate solution that we're all -- that we all should be looking for.

Q    (Inaudible.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Julie, throughout this process, I think people have constantly looked for an easy, low-cost answer -- whether it’s we should have sent more rifles in early and somehow then everything would have been okay; or if I had taken that shot even after Assad offered to give up his chemical weapons, then immediately things would have folded, or the Assad regime would have folded, and we would have suddenly seen a peaceful Syria. 

This is a hugely, difficult, complex problem.  And I would have hoped that we would have learned that from Afghanistan and Iraq, where we have devoted enormous time and effort and resources with the very best people and have given the Afghan people and the Iraqi people an opportunity for democracy.  But it’s still hard, as we saw this week in Afghanistan.  That's not by virtue of a lack of effort on our part, or a lack of commitment.  We’ve still got 10,000 folks in Afghanistan.  We're still spending billions of dollar supporting that government, and it’s still tough.

So when I make a decision about the level of military involvement that we're prepared to engage in, in Syria, I have to make a judgment based on, once we start something we’ve got to finish it, and we’ve got to do it well.  And do we, in fact, have the resources and the capacity to make a serious impact -- understanding that we’ve still got to go after ISIL in Iraq; we still have to support the training of an Iraqi military that is weaker than any of us perceived; that we still have business to do in Afghanistan.  And so I push -- and have consistently over the last four, five years sought out a wide range of opinions about steps that we can take potentially to move Syria in a better direction. 

I am under no illusions about what an incredible humanitarian catastrophe this is, and the hardships that we're seeing, and the refugees that are traveling in very dangerous circumstances and now creating real political problems among our allies in Europe, and the heartbreaking images of children drowned trying to escape war, and the potential impact of such a destabilized country on our allies in the region.  But what we have learned over the last 10, 12, 13 years is that unless we can get the parties on the ground to agree to live together in some fashion, then no amount of U.S. military engagement will solve the problem.  And we will find ourselves either doing just a little bit and not making a difference, and losing credibility that way, or finding ourselves drawn in deeper and deeper into a situation that we can't sustain.

And when I hear people offering up half-baked ideas as if they are solutions, or trying to downplay the challenges involved in this situation -- what I’d like to see people ask is, specifically, precisely, what exactly would you do, and how would you fund it, and how would you sustain it?  And typically, what you get is a bunch of mumbo jumbo. 

So these are hard challenges.  They are ones that we are going to continue to pursue.  The topline message that I want everybody to understand is we are going to continue to go after ISIL.  We are going to continue to reach out to a moderate opposition.  We reject Russia’s theory that everybody opposed to Assad is a terrorist.  We think that is self-defeating.  It will get them into a quagmire.  It will be used as a further recruitment tool for foreign fighters.

We will work with the international community and our coalition to relieve the humanitarian pressure.  On refugees, we are working with the Turks and others to see what we can do along the border to make things safer for people.  But ultimately, we're going to have to find a way for a political transition if we're going to solve Syria.

Jon Karl.

Q    Thank you, Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

Q    Back in July you said that the gun issue has been the most frustrating of your presidency, and we certainly heard that frustration from you last night.

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

Q    So in the last 15 months of your presidency, do you intend to do anything differently to get Congress to act or to do something about this gun violence problem? 

And I have to get you to respond to something that Jeb Bush just said, and to be fair to Governor Bush I want to read it directly.  Asked about the drive to take action in light of what happened in Oregon, he said, “Look, stuff happens.  There’s always a crisis.  And the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not always the right thing to do.”  How would you react to Governor Bush?

THE PRESIDENT:  I don't even think I have to react to that one.  (Laughter.)  I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments, based on the fact that every couple of months, we have a mass shooting, and in terms of -- and they can decide whether they consider that “stuff happening”. 

In terms of what I can do, I’ve asked my team -- as I have in the past -- to scrub what kinds of authorities do we have to enforce the laws that we have in place more effectively to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.  Are there additional actions that we can take that might prevent even a handful of these tragic deaths from taking place?  But as I said last night, this will not change until the politics change and the behavior of elected officials changes.

And so the main thing I’m going to do is I’m going to talk about this on a regular basis, and I will politicize it because our inaction is a political decision that we are making.

The reason that Congress does not support even the modest gun safety laws that we proposed after Sandy Hook is not because the majority of the American people don’t support it.  I mean, normally, politicians are responsive to the views of the electorate.  Here you’ve got the majority of the American people think it’s the right thing to do.  Background checks, other common-sense steps that would maybe save some lives couldn’t even get a full vote.  And why is that?  It’s because of politics.  It’s because interest groups fund campaigns, feed people fear. And in fairness, it’s not just in the Republican Party -- although the Republican Party is just uniformly opposed to all gun safety laws.  And unless we change that political dynamic, we’re not going to be able to make a big dent in this problem.

For example, you’ll hear people talk about the problem is not guns, it’s mental illness.  Well, if you talk to people who study this problem, it is true that the majority of these mass shooters are angry young men, but there are hundreds of millions of angry young men around the world -- tens of millions of angry young men.  Most of them don’t shoot.  It doesn’t help us just to identify -- and the majority of people who have mental illnesses are not shooters.  So we can’t sort through and identify ahead of time who might take actions like this.  The only thing we can do is make sure that they can’t have an entire arsenal when something snaps in them.

And if we’re going to do something about that, the politics has to change.  The politics has to change.  And the people who are troubled by this have to be as intense and as organized and as adamant about this issue as folks on the other side who are absolutists and think that any gun safety measures are somehow an assault on freedom, or communistic -- or a plot by me to takeover and stay in power forever or something.  (Laughter.)  I mean, there are all kinds of crackpot conspiracy theories that float around there -- some of which, by the way, are ratified by elected officials in the other party on occasion.

So we’ve got to change the politics of this.  And that requires people to feel -- not just feel deeply -- because I get a lot of letters after this happens -- “do something!”  Well, okay, here’s what you need to do.  You have to make sure that anybody who you are voting for is on the right side of this issue.  And if they’re not, even if they’re great on other stuff, for a couple of election cycles you’ve got to vote against them, and let them know precisely why you’re voting against them.  And you just have to, for a while, be a single-issue voter because that’s what is happening on the other side. 

And that’s going to take some time.  I mean, the NRA has had a good start.  They’ve been at this a long time, they’ve perfected what they do.  You’ve got to give them credit -- they’re very effective, because they don’t represent the majority of the American people but they know how to stir up fear; they know how to stir up their base; they know how to raise money; they know how to scare politicians; they know how to organize campaigns.  And the American people are going to have to match them in their sense of urgency if we’re actually going to stop this.

Which isn’t to say stopping all violence.  We’re not going to stop all violence.  Violence exists around the world, sadly.  Part of original sin.  But our homicide rates are just a lot higher than other places -- that, by the way, have the same levels of violence.  It’s just you can’t kill as many people when you don’t have easy access to these kinds of weapons. 

And I’m deeply saddened about what happened yesterday.  But Arne is going back to Chicago -- let’s not forget, this is happening every single day in forgotten neighborhoods around the country.  Every single day.  Kids are just running for their lives, trying to get to school.  Broderick, when we were down in New Orleans, sitting down with a group of young men, when we were talking about Katrina, and I’ve got two young men next to me, both of them had been shot multiple times.  They were barely 20. 

So we got to make a decision.  If we think that’s normal, then we have to own it.  I don’t think it’s normal.  I think it’s abnormal.  I think we should change it.  But I can’t do it by myself. 

So the main thing I’m going to do, Jon, is talk about it.  And hope that over time I’m changing enough minds -- along with other leaders around the country -- that we start finally seeing some action.  I don’t think it’s going to happen overnight.

Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  To go back to your opening remarks, you said that you won’t sign another short-term CR.  But as you know, yesterday Secretary Lew announced that the government’s borrowing authority would run out around November 5th.  Would you recommend negotiating an increase in the debt ceiling as part of these budget negotiations on spending caps?  And also does the Speaker’s race complicate these negotiations?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m sure the Speaker’s race complicates these negotiations.  (Laughter.)  That was a rhetorical question. (Laughter.)  It will complicate the negotiations.  But when it comes to the debt ceiling, we're not going back there. 

Maybe it’s been a while, so let me just refresh everybody’s memory.  Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize us to spend more, it simply authorizes us to pay the bills that we have already incurred.  It is the way for the United States to maintain its good credit rating -- the full faith and credit of the United States. 

Historically, we do not mess with it.  If it gets messed with, it would have profound implications for the global economy and could put our financial system in the kind of tailspin that we saw back in 2007-2008.  It’s just a bad thing to do.  So we're not going to negotiate on that.  It has to get done in the next five weeks.  So even though the continuing resolution to keep the government open lasts for 10 weeks, we have to get the debt ceiling raised in five.  You've got a shorter timetable to get that done.

But here’s the bottom line:  Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, myself, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid -- we’ve all spoken and talked about trying to negotiate a budget agreement.  And, yes, Speaker Boehner’s decision to step down complicates it.  But I do think that there is still a path for us to come up with a reasonable agreement that raises the spending caps above sequester to make sure that we can properly finance both our defense and nondefense needs, that maintains a prudent control of our deficits, and that we can do that in short order.  It’s not that complicated.  The math is the math.

And what I’ve encouraged is that we get started on that work immediately, and we push through over the next several weeks -- and try to leave out extraneous issues that may prevent us from getting a budget agreement. 

I know, for example, that there are many Republicans who are exercised about Planned Parenthood.  And I deeply disagree with them on that issue, and I think that it’s mischaracterized what Planned Parenthood does.  But I understand that they feel strongly about it, and I respect that.  But you can't have an issue like that potentially wreck the entire U.S. economy -- any more than I should hold the entire budget hostage to my desire to do something about gun violence.  I feel just as strongly about that and I think I’ve got better evidence for it.  But the notion that I would threaten the Republicans that unless they passed gun safety measures that would stop mass shootings I’m going to shut down the government and not sign an increase in the debt ceiling would be irresponsible of me.  And the American people, rightly, would reject that.

Well, same is true for them.  There are some fights that we fight individually.  They want to defund Planned Parenthood, there’s a way to do it.  Pass a law, override my veto.  That's true across a whole bunch of issues that they disagree with me on, and that's how democracy works.  I got no problem with that.

But you have to govern.  And I’m hoping that the next Speaker understands that the problem Speaker Boehner had or Mitch McConnell had in not dismantling Obamacare, or not eliminating the Department of Education, or not deporting every immigrant in this country was not because Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell didn't care about conservative principles.  It had to do with the fact that they can't do it in our system of government, which requires compromise.  Just like I can't do everything I want in passing an immigration bill, or passing a gun safety bill.  And that doesn't mean, then, I throw a tantrum and try to wreck the economy, and put hardworking Americans who are just now able to dig themselves out of a massive recession, put them in harm’s way.  Wrong thing to do.

Peter Alexander.

Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  You addressed -- I want to follow up on Jon’s questions about the issue that’s obviously deeply personal and moving to you -- that is the gun issue.  Apart from Congress’s inaction, apart from the desire for new laws and, beyond that, apart from the gun lobby, as you noted, the pattern is that these perpetrators are angry, aggrieved, oftentimes mentally ill young men.  Is there something that you can do with the bully pulpit, with your moral authority, with your remaining time in office to help reach these individuals who believe that gun violence is the way out? 

THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I think I can continue to speak to the American people as a whole and hopefully model for them basic social norms about rejecting violence, and cooperation and caring for other people.  But there are a lot of young men out there.  And having been one myself once, I can tell you that us being able to identify or pinpoint who might have problems is extraordinarily difficult. 

So I think we, as a culture, should continuously think about how we can nurture our kids, protect our kids, talk to them about conflict resolution, discourage violence.  And I think there are poor communities where, rather than mass shootings, you're seeing just normal interactions that used to be settled by a fistfight settled with guns where maybe intervention programs and mentorship and things like that can work.  That's the kind of thing that we're trying to encourage through My Brother’s Keeper.

But when it comes to reaching every disaffected young man, 99 percent of -- or 99.9 percent of whom will hopefully grow out of it -- I don't think that there’s a silver bullet there.  The way we are going to solve this problem is that when they act out, when they are disturbed, when that particular individual has a problem, that they can't easily access weapons that can perpetrate mass violence on a lot of people. 

Because that's what other countries do.  Again, I want to emphasize this.  There’s no showing that somehow we are inherently more violent than any other advanced nation, or that young men are inherently more violent in our nation than they are in other nations.  I will say young men inherently are more violent than the rest of the population, but there’s no sense that somehow this is -- it’s something in the American character that is creating this.  Levels of violence are on par between the United States and other advanced countries.  What is different is homicide rates and gun violence rates and mass shooting rates.  So it’s not that the behavior or the impulses are necessarily different as much as it is that they have access to more powerful weapons.

Julia Edwards.

Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  You just said that you reject President Putin’s approach to Syria and his attacks on moderate opposition forces.  You said it was a recipe for disaster.  But what are you willing to do to stop President Putin and protect moderate opposition fighters?  Would you consider imposing sanctions against Russia?  Would you go so far as to equip moderate rebels with anti-aircraft weapons to protect them from Russian air attacks?  And how do you respond to critics who say Putin is outsmarting you, that he took a measure of you in Ukraine and he felt he could get away with it?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I’ve heard it all before.  (Laughter.) I’ve got to say I’m always struck by the degree to which not just critics but I think people buy this narrative. 

Let’s think about this.  So when I came into office seven and a half years ago, America had precipitated the worst financial crisis in history, dragged the entire world into a massive recession.  We were involved in two wars with almost no coalition support.  U.S. -- world opinion about the United States was at a nadir -- we were just barely above Russia at that time, and I think potentially slightly below China’s.  And we were shedding 800,000 jobs a month, and so on and so forth. 

And today, we're the strongest large advanced economy in the world -- probably one of the few bright spots in the world economy.  Our approval ratings have gone up.  We are more active on more international issues and forge international responses to everything from Ebola to countering ISIL. 

Meanwhile, Mr. Putin comes into office at a time when the economy had been growing and they were trying to pivot to a more diversified economy, and as a consequence of these brilliant moves, their economy is contracting 4 percent this year.  They are isolated in the world community, subject to sanctions that are not just applied by us but by what used to be some of their closest trading partners.  Their main allies in the Middle East were Libya and Syria -- Mr. Gaddafi and Mr. Assad -- and those countries are falling apart.  And he’s now just had to send in troops and aircraft in order to prop up this regime, at the risk of alienating the entire Sunni world. 

So what was the question again?  (Laughter.) 

No, but I think it’s really interesting to understand.  Russia is not stronger as a consequence of what they’ve been doing.  They get attention.  The sanctions against Ukraine are still in place.  And what I’ve consistently offered -- from a position of strength, because the United States is not subject to sanctions and we’re not contracting 4 percent a year -- what I’ve offered is a pathway whereby they can get back onto a path of growth and do right by their people. 

So Mr. Putin’s actions have been successful only insofar as it’s boosted his poll ratings inside of Russia -- which may be why the beltway is so impressed, because that tends to be the measure of success.  Of course, it’s easier to do when you’ve got a state-controlled media. 

But this is not a smart, strategic move on Russia’s part.  And what Russia has now done is not only committed its own troops into a situation in which the overwhelming majority of the Syrian population sees it now as an enemy, but the Sunni population throughout the Middle East is going to see it as a supporter, an endorser, of those barrel bombs landing on kids -- at a time when Russia has a significant Muslim population inside of its own borders that it needs to worry about.

So I want Russia to be successful.  This is not a contest between the United States and Russia.  It is in our interest for Russia to be a responsible, effective actor on the international stage that can share burdens with us, along with China, along with Europe, along with Japan, along with other countries -- because the problems we have are big.  So I’m hopeful that Mr. Putin, having made this doubling-down of the support he has provided to Mr. Assad, recognizes that this is not going to be a good long-term strategy and that he works instead to bring about a political settlement. 

Just as I hope that they can resolve the issues with Ukraine in a way that recognizes Russian equities but upholds the basic principle of sovereignty and independence that the Ukrainian people should enjoy like everybody else.  But until that time, we’re going to continue to have tensions and we’re going to continue to have differences. 

But we’re not going to make Syria into a proxy war between the United States and Russia.  That would be bad strategy on our part.  This is a battle between Russia, Iran, and Assad against the overwhelming majority of the Syrian people.  Our battle is with ISIL, and our battle is with the entire international community to resolve the conflict in a way that can end the bloodshed and end the refugee crisis, and allow people to be at home, work, grow food, shelter their children, send those kids to school.  That’s the side we’re on. 

This is not some superpower chessboard contest.  And anybody who frames it in that way isn’t paying very close attention to what’s been happening on the chessboard.

All right, last question.  Major Garrett.

Q    Mr. President, good to see you.

THE PRESIDENT:  Good to see you.

Q    And for the children there, I promise I won’t take too long.  So you’ve been very patient.

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve been boring them to death, I guarantee it.  (Laughter.)  But there have been times where I’ve snagged rebounds for Ryan when he is shooting three-pointers so he has got to put up with this.  (Laughter.)

Q    Understood.  Mr. President, I wonder if you could tell the country to what degree you were changed or moved by what you discussed in private with Pope Francis?  What do you think his visit might have meant for the country long term?  And for Democrats who might already be wondering, is it too late for Joe Biden to decide whether or not to run for President?  And lastly, just to clarify, to what degree did Hillary Clinton’s endorsement just yesterday of a no-fly zone put her in a category of embracing a half-baked answer on Syria that borders on mumbo jumbo?

THE PRESIDENT:  On the latter issue, on the last question that you asked, Hillary Clinton is not half-baked in terms of her approach to these problems.  She was obviously my Secretary of State.  But I also think that there’s a difference between running for President and being President, and the decisions that are being made and the discussions that I’m having with the Joint Chiefs become much more specific and require, I think, a different kind of judgment.  And that’s what I’ll continue to apply as long as I’m here.  And if and when she’s President, then she’ll make those judgments.  And she’s been there enough that she knows that these are tough calls but that --

Q    -- that she should know better?

THE PRESIDENT:  No, that’s not what I said.  That’s perhaps what you said.  What I’m saying is, is that we all want to try to relieve the suffering in Syria, but my job is to make sure that whatever we do we are doing in a way that serves the national security interests of the American people; that doesn’t lead to us getting into things that we can’t get out of or that we cannot do effectively; and as much as possible, that we’re working with international partners. 

And we’re going to continue to explore things that we can do to protect people and to deal with the humanitarian situation there, and to provide a space in which we can bring about the kind of political transition that’s going to be required to solve the problem.  And I think Hillary Clinton would be the first to say that when you’re sitting in the seat that I’m sitting in, in the Situation Room, things look a little bit different -- because she’s been right there next to me.

I love Joe Biden, and he’s got his own decisions to make, and I’ll leave it at that.  And in the meantime, he’s doing a great job as Vice President and has been really helpful on a whole bunch of issues.

Pope Francis I love.  He is a good man with a warm heart and a big moral imagination.  And I think he had such an impact in his visit here -- as he has had around the world -- because he cares so deeply about the least of these, and in that sensea expresses what I consider to be, as a Christian, the essence of Christianity.  And he’s got a good sense of humor.  (Laughter.)  Well, I can’t share all his jokes.  They were all clean.  (Laughter.)

And as I said in the introduction in the South Lawn when he appeared here at the White House, I think it’s really useful that he makes us uncomfortable in his gentle way; that he’s constantly prodding people’s consciences and asking everybody all across the political spectrum what more you can do to be kind, and to be helpful, and to love, and to sacrifice, and to serve.  And in that sense, I don’t think he’s somebody where we should be applying the typical American political measures -- liberal and conservative, and left and right -- I think he is speaking to all of our consciences, and we all have to then search ourselves to see if there are ways that we can do better.

Q    (Inaudible.)

THE PRESIDENT:  It did.  I think that when I spend time with somebody like the Pontiff -- and there are other individuals, some of whom are famous, some of whom are not, but who are good people and deeply moral -- then it makes me want to be better, makes me want to do better.  And those people are great gifts to the world.  And sometimes they’re just a teacher in a classroom. And sometimes they’re your neighbor.  And sometimes they’re your mom, or your wife.  Sometimes they’re your kids.  But they can encourage you to be better.  That’s what we’re all trying to do.

And that’s part of the wonderful thing about Pope Francis, is the humility that he brings to do this.  His rejection of the absolutism that says I’m 100 percent right and you’re 100 percent wrong; but rather, we are all sinners and we are all children of God.  That’s a pretty good starting point for being better.

All right.  Thank you, guys, for your patience.  You can now go home.  (Laughter.) 

THE PRESIDENT:  Please be seated, everybody.  Good afternoon.  

Arne Duncan is one of my longest-serving Cabinet Secretaries, and he’s been a friend for a lot longer than that.  So it’s with some regret and sorrow that I’ve accepted his decision to return to our hometown of Chicago.  After more than six years of living in Washington, Arne’s wonderful wife, Karen, and their excellent kids, Claire and Ryan -- who are also buddies of mine -- wanted to move back home.  And that’s meant in the interim a lot of time apart.  

So I’ll be honest -- I pushed Arne to stay.  Sorry, guys.  But I also know from personal experience how hard it is to be away from your family on a sustained basis.  So while I will miss Arne deeply, he’s more than earned the right to return home.

Take a look at what Arne has accomplished over the last six and a half years.  He’s one of the longest-serving Secretaries of Education in our history -- and one of the more consequential.  In just a few years, Arne and his team have delivered some incredible results at every stage of the educational experience. More than 30 states have upped their investment in early childhood education.  Nearly every state in America has raised standards for teaching and learning, and expectations for what our kids can learn, and our high school graduation rate is at an all-time high.  We’ve helped millions more families afford college, and more Americans are graduating from college than ever before.  And that’s just scratching the surface.

Arne has done more to bring our educational system -- sometimes kicking and screaming -- into the 21st century than anybody else.  America is going to be better off for what he has done.  It's going to be more competitive and more prosperous.  It is going to be more equal and more upwardly mobile.  It’s a record that I truly believe no other Education Secretary can match.  Arne bleeds this stuff.  He cares so much about our kids. And he's been so passionate about this work.  And everybody who interacts with him, including people who disagree with him on some issues, never questions the genuineness and heart that he has brought to this job.  

So I couldn't be prouder of him.  And, for good measure, Arne also holds the record for most points scored in an NBA All-Star game.  (Applause.)  And he is my favorite partner in pickup basketball -- (laughter) -- the smartest player I know -- even though he’s very slow -- (laughter) -- and has no hops.  (Laughter.)  He knows it's true.  I will say, watching Ryan, by the way, that the son will soon be surpassing the father because this young man has got game.

Now, keep in mind, none of this change has been easy, and we still have a long way to go.  One of the things about education is that it doesn’t deliver results tomorrow or the next day; this is a decade-long or longer proposition.   We plant seeds now; we make changes now; and we watch each successive class benefit from these reforms.  And it goes in fits and starts, and we have a decentralized system -- that's how our education tradition evolved.  So it's not easy and it's not quick, but we are making progress.  And we're not going to stop in these last 15 months.

And that's why it's so important and why I think we're very lucky that, even as Arne steps down, we've got an exceptionally talented educator to step in -- and that is Dr. John King.  

John is already on Arne’s leadership team.  He’s been an educator all his life -- a teacher, a principal, a leader of schools, the New York State’s education chief.  He’s the right man to lead the department.  He shares our commitment to preparing every child for success in a more innovative and competitive world.  He’s got a great team already at the Department of Education of which I am very, very proud.  His family is equally cool and good-looking.  (Laughter.)  And he has equally exceptional children.  And I know that, together, we're going to continue to be able to do great things on behalf of all our kids.

So, Arne and John, I want to wish both of you a hardy congratulations and good luck.

Now I'm going to let them say a few words, and then I'm just going to make a few remarks before I take some questions from the press. 

We'll start with Arne.

SECRETARY DUNCAN:  I've cried more today than I have in a while, so I'll try not to get up here and cry.  

I’ll start with the President.  And when he asked us to come to D.C. and work with him, that was about a one-minute conversation with my wife.  And it wasn’t that we wanted to leave Chicago; it wasn’t that I necessarily wanted to be the Education Secretary -- I just wanted to be on his team and believed so much in what he was about and what he stood for.  

And I have to say, seven and a half years later, my admiration is only greater.  And it’s pretty remarkable -- it’s important for the folks to know, that every hard decision, his only question was, what’s the right thing to do for kids, and challenging us and our team to fight for kids every single day.  And often, that was a hard political decision, and that was never a factor.  His passion and his commitment has been absolutely extraordinary.  For me, it’s not the political leadership; it’s not the educational leadership; it’s the moral leadership.  

And I just can’t tell you, Mr. President, personally, what an unbelievable honor it was just to spend some time.  

And for those -- every day you see -- for folks who watched him last night talking about the horrendous massacre, gun massacre in Oregon, and how preventable these things are, we need that moral leadership.  And please keep that fight

To our team, the team you have at the White House -- Cecilia and Denis and Valerie and others -- it’s been extraordinary to work with DPC.  I don’t say this lightly -- I think our team at the Department of Education is stronger than it’s ever been.  You never know over seven, eight years, how those teams go, and do you have the B team towards the end -- well, I think we have the A team and a combination of being able to work with the White House -- Shaun and Sylvia and so many folks are here -- Anthony. We have the team in place.  I’m just extraordinarily hopeful and confident about what they can do together.  

Emma and Ted, and the rest of the crew -- you said a little bit about John -- and folks know, for all of us, this work is very, very personal.  For the President, it’s very personal.  For me it’s very personal.  John was one of those kids that probably shouldn’t be in a room like this, if you sort of look at the stereotypes.  And not the easiest time growing up -- he’ll tell you more about it -- he lost both his parents at a pretty early age; went to live with his brother.  That wasn’t very easy either.  But he had an amazing teacher who saw something in him, who kept him going.  And today, he gets to stand here with the President.  

And so many times, I think we, as a society, write off kids that look like John and come from places like John.  And to see what he can accomplish -- I think that’s what drives all of us.  We know there are so many other kids out there we can reach.

And while I’m deeply, deeply sad to be leaving, I’m extraordinarily happy and thankful and proud that John is going to carry on this work with the team.  So I want to thank everybody for their hard work.

I quickly want to -- try not to get emotional here -- but thank my parents, as well.  My dad was a lifelong educator at the University of Chicago, taught throughout his life.  My mother started an inner-city tutoring program before we were born, and raised all of us as a part of that program.  And that changed our lives.  And all our life, we saw what kids could do when they were given a chance.  And that’s why we do this work today.  And to be able to see what she did at one little corner at 46th and Greenwood, and to now have a chance over the past six and a half years to try and have an impact around the nation, because this man gave us a chance -- for my family, I can’t tell you how much it means to us.

And then, finally, just to my family.  I love this work.  I love this team.  I love the President.  I love the chance to serve.  The only thing I love more is you guys.  And I can’t wait to come home and see a couple more track meets and maybe get to coach Ryan a little bit, and maybe have a few more dinners, and maybe go to a movie someday -- that would be pretty amazing.  (Laughter.)  

THE PRESIDENT:  Wow!  All right!

SECRETARY DUNCAN:  It’s been too long.  And so it’s been an amazing, amazing journey and I feel so proud and so lucky to have been a part of this team.  And, Mr. President, thanks for creating the climate in which all of us here -- all of us here --could have the impact we did.  And we can never repay the debt of gratitude we owe you for your leadership and your courage.  So thank you so much.  

And I want to turn it over to John.  (Applause.)


DR. KING:  Thank you, Arne, for very kind words.  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to serve and for the faith that you've placed in me and the team that we have at the department.

I’m deeply honored by the chance to serve and also deeply humbled by following in Arne’s footsteps.  Arne is an extraordinary leader who I have watched demonstrate tremendous courage in fighting for kids and fighting for what’s best for kids; but also he’s been willing to listen -- to listen to folks and to make adjustments, and to make sure that everything we do every day is towards the goal of greater equity.

Mr. President, you and Arne and our team at the department have laid out an ambitious agenda -- from strengthening early childhood education and expanding access to early childhood, to raising standards for teaching and learning in K through 12, to ensuring that more Americans have access to high-quality higher education, to ensuring that we support our teachers and that we invest in our teachers and provide the best preparation and support and leadership opportunities for them.  It’s an incredible agenda, and I’m proud to be able to carry it forward with the amazing team that we have at the department. 

Earlier this week, Arne gave a speech at the National Press Club, and in that speech, Arne said education can be the difference between life and death.  And I know that's true because it was for me.  I grew up in Brooklyn.  I lost my mom when I was eight; my dad when I was 12.  My dad was very sick before he passed.  I moved around between family members and schools.  But teachers, New York City public school teachers, are the reason that I am alive.  They are the reason that I became a teacher.  They are the reason I am standing here today.  Those teachers created amazing educational experiences, but also gave me hope -- hope about what is possible, what could be possible for me in life.

I know schools can't do it alone.  There’s work we have to do on economic development and housing and health care.  But I know that my parents -- who spent their lives as New York City public school educators -- believed that school was at the heart of our promise of equality of opportunity for all Americans.  That's what they believed.  That's what the President believes.  That's what Arne believes.  And that's what I feel very privileged to be able to work on with this amazing team we have at the department. 

Every child in the United States, every college student, every disconnected youth, every working parent who just wants a few more credits in order to improve their salary and position at their job -- everyone deserves the kind of opportunity that I had to have a great education.  Every child deserves the kind of opportunity that my beautiful daughters, Amina and Mireya, have to have a great education, the kind of education their grandparents worked to provide.

I’m so grateful to my very supportive wife, Melissa.  So grateful to the Secretary for the opportunity he gave me to join his team, and incredibly grateful to the President for the opportunity to work with a wonderful group of people at the Education Department to try to expand opportunity.  

Thank you.  (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.

Two good men, doing really important work.  So I'm lucky to have them, both as colleagues and as friends, and I'm looking forward to seeing even more work done in the next few months.

We've got some other business to attend to.  So all of you who are here to celebrate Arne and John, you're lucky enough now to have to sit through -- (laughter) -- a little bit of a press conference with me.  So make yourselves comfortable.  (Laughter.) I warned the kids ahead of time.  I said, try not to look completely bored.  (Laughter.) 

THE PRESIDENT:  There’s been another mass shooting in America -- this time, in a community college in Oregon.

That means there are more American families -- moms, dads, children -- whose lives have been changed forever.  That means there’s another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children.  

I’ve been to Roseburg, Oregon.  There are really good people there.  I want to thank all the first responders whose bravery likely saved some lives today.  Federal law enforcement has been on the scene in a supporting role, and we’ve offered to stay and help as much as Roseburg needs, for as long as they need.

In the coming days, we’ll learn about the victims -- young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard, their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives.  And America will wrap everyone who’s grieving with our prayers and our love.  

But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough.  It’s not enough.  It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel.  And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America -- next week, or a couple of months from now.

We don't yet know why this individual did what he did.  And it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations may be.  But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people.  We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.  

Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, “The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws -- even in the face of repeated mass killings.”  And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana.  That day!  Somehow this has become routine.  The reporting is routine.  My response here at this podium ends up being routine.  The conversation in the aftermath of it.  We've become numb to this.

We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston.  It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.  

And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation.  Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out:  We need more guns, they’ll argue.  Fewer gun safety laws.  

Does anybody really believe that?  There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country --they know that's not true.  We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws -- including the majority of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.  

There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America.  So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer?  We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths.  So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence.

We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings.  Friends of ours, allies of ours -- Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours.  So we know there are ways to prevent it.  

And, of course, what’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.  Well, this is something we should politicize.  It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.  I would ask news organizations -- because I won't put these facts forward -- have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who’ve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.  This won't be information coming from me; it will be coming from you.  We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so.  And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths.  How can that be?

This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America.  We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.  When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer.  When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer.  When roads are unsafe, we fix them to reduce auto fatalities.  We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives.  So the notion that gun violence is somehow different, that our freedom and our Constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law-abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations doesn’t make sense.

So, tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate, I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up.  And that will require a change of politics on this issue.  And it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision.  If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.

And I would particularly ask America’s gun owners -- who are using those guns properly, safely, to hunt, for sport, for protecting their families -- to think about whether your views are properly being represented by the organization that suggests it's speaking for you.

And each time this happens I'm going to bring this up.  Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws.  And this is not something I can do by myself.  I've got to have a Congress and I've got to have state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this.  

I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances.  But based on my experience as President, I can't guarantee that.  And that's terrible to say.  And it can change.

May God bless the memories of those who were killed today.  May He bring comfort to their families, and courage to the injured as they fight their way back.  And may He give us the strength to come together and find the courage to change.

Thank you.  

THE PRESIDENT:   Thank you so much.  Everybody have a seat.  Well, welcome to the White House.  I invited all of you here because if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you’ve got to be nice to state legislators.  (Laughter.)  You never know when one of them might end up being President.  (Laughter.)  So you want to treat them with respect.

It is great to see all of you.  I hope that Jerry has been treating you and our team have been treating you reasonably well.  (Applause.)  I am partial to state legislators -- particularly, by the way, senators.  I’m sorry, House members.  (Laughter and applause.)  I’m just saying we tend to be a little more sensible, at least at the state levels -- I don’t know about the federal.  (Laughter.)

I see my friend Jim from Illinois back here -- Jim Clayborne.  And he and I served together, and he is still doing a great job.  My first campaign for the State Senate was nearly 20 years ago.  I had to print my own fliers at Kinko’s.  (Laughter.)    Hardly anybody could pronounce my name.  We had to go door to door -- Michelle and me and a handful of volunteers just to get enough petitions to get on the ballot.  And just about everybody who I talked to -- when they did bother talking to me, because there were a number of times where people didn’t answer the door or figured I was selling something or preaching something.  If they did answer the door and heard me speak for a while, they’d say, well, you seem like a nice young man -- why would you want to go into something dirty and nasty like politics?  (Laughter.)  And I’m sure some of you have heard that not just from strangers, but from your family members.

But what drove me to run for office, and what I’m sure drove many of you, is the conviction that politics can, in fact, be a noble profession; that you can, in fact, help to shape and create more opportunity in communities and districts and states and in our nation.  And the more time I spent in my community, the more convinced I was that although change happens from the bottom up -- and it is critical for communities to embrace nongovernmental organizations and community organizations and philanthropies and faith communities in trying to make sure that our schools are working and that our streets are safe and that people have jobs and opportunity -- ultimately, we also need to have a government that is an effective partner, that is not there just to try to stay in power or score cheap political points or get on the nightly news, but elected representatives that are genuinely trying to move the ball forward and try to bring our country together rather than divide it.

And that ideal -- the belief that people who love this country can change it -– is why I ran for this office eight years ago.  The financial crisis hadn’t happened yet, and it turned out that that would make our job a lot harder.  But when you look back on these last seven years, we’ve made enormous progress.  (Applause.)  

Now, let’s face it.  You’re not going to hear that progress acknowledged from the folks on the other side who are running for this office at the moment, and I understand that.  That’s the nature of politics.  But somehow they’ve invented a reality that everything was terrific back in 2007, 2008 -– when the unemployment and the uninsured rate were skyrocketing, and when our economy was shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs every month, and we were mired in two wars, and hopelessly addicted to foreign oil, and bin Laden was still plotting.  Apparently those were the good old days before I came in and messed things up.  (Laughter.) 

But there is this pesky thing called facts.  And here are the facts.  When I took office, the unemployment rate was on its way to 10 percent.  Today, it is at 5.1 percent.  (Applause.)  When I took office, we were losing up to 800,000 jobs a month.  Today, our businesses have created jobs for a record 66 months in a row –- more than *3 million [13 million] overall.  There are more job openings right now, in fact, than any time in our history.

When I took office, more than *15,000 Americans [15 percent of Americans] were uninsured.  Today, only 9.2 percent are uninsured.  And if we can get a few more states to expand Medicaid then even fewer will be uninsured.  (Applause.) 

So for the first time on record, more than 90 percent of Americans have health insurance.  And for the first time, insurance companies can’t discriminate against you because of a preexisting condition, which is helping all of us.  And by the way, despite the predictions, we’ve done all this and cut the deficit by two-thirds since I took office.  (Applause.) 

When I took office, we were hopelessly addicted to foreign oil.  Today, we’ve cut our oil imports by more than half.  We’ve tripled the power that we generate from wind.  We generate 20 times more solar energy than we did when I came into office.  And that has proven to be a steady source of good jobs that can’t be outsourced.

Our reading scores are up.  Our high school graduation rates are up.  Our college attendance is up.  There are almost no economic indicators that don't show we have made enormous progress during the course of these last seven years, and we’ve done it in partnership with so many of you and so many state governments around the country.

I’m going to hold up my record up against anybody.  Our policy prescriptions have been the right ones.  We are on the right side of these debates that are taking place right now.  And those things that are not yet done, aren’t done because we got folks on the other side that are intent on saying no -- even when they know it’s the right thing to do; even when it’s -- originally was their idea.  

On issue after issue, the American people agree.  The majority of Americans agree we should raise the minimum wage.  A majority of Americans agree we should institute paid family leave and sick days for our workers.  One recent poll, run by a Republican pollster, showed that a majority of Republican voters think that climate change is caused by human activity and that their elected officials should do something about it.  The only thing that makes climate change “political” is that not one -- not a single one of the top 10 candidates for President on the other side agree with these Republican voters -- unique among conservative parties worldwide.  

The point is, Americans are not actually as divided as our politics or sometimes our media would suggest on particular issues.  We sort ourselves out partly because we're watching different things and reading different things.  But when you actually ask people their opinions on issues, there is a convergence there.  There’s a path for us to act in a unified way.  But it requires elected officials to be serious about getting the job done, as opposed to winning the next election.  And we are ready to build on that progress.  We’re ready to build on what works.  And our policies are the ones that work.

So part of our task is to make sure that both sides of the aisle at every level of government get the message that people are looking for us to actually do what makes sense and what the evidence and facts show are going to help working families.  And the good news is that it looks like the Republicans will just barely avoid shutting down the government for the second time in two years.  That’s a somewhat low bar, but we should celebrate where we can.  (Laughter.)  The bad news is that it looks like Republicans will just barely avoid shutting down the government again for the second time in two years.  Instead of manufacturing new crises, Congress should be investing in the things that help our economy grow.  

Now, given that, at least for the next year, year and a half, there’s not going to be the kind of action on a wide range of issues that we’d like to see coming out of Capitol Hill, that puts more of a burden -- but also a great opportunity -- on state legislatures all across the country.  Because you can act when Washington won’t.  

The Republican-led Congress hasn’t raised America’s minimum wage, but 17 states did it on their own, and that boosted wages for 7 million workers.  So you are to be congratulated for that.  That’s your work.  (Applause.)  Congress hasn’t answered my call to provide our workers with paid sick days and paid family leave, but four states have now taken action on their own, including Oregon this year.  So congratulations, Oregon.  We’re proud of you.  (Applause.)   Congress has not yet taken up my plan to bring down the cost of community college to zero for responsible students, but this year, two of your states took action to make sure that every hardworking young person can afford the new skills that they need to get a good job. 

So over the last few years, states likes yours have gotten a lot done.  And I hope you’re going to head back home ready to get even more done -- whether it’s some of the issues I already mentioned, or expanding pre-K, or modernizing licensing laws to help workers and our veterans fill those jobs, or putting into place some limits on the amount of carbon pollution that power plants can generate and dump into our air -- we’ve got to keep moving forward.  And we’ve got to keep measuring success not just by winning elections -- although I do want us to do a little more work and pay a little more attention to state and legislative elections and gubernatorial elections and not just focus on national politics, because that’s where a lot of decisions get made -- but I want us most importantly, to be focusing on how we’re helping people in their own lives every single day. 
 
At its worst, politics can be a dirty business.  It can be a tool for those with wealth and power to rig the system so that they can keep that wealth and power.  It can be a place where elected officials shy away from tough issues because they’re not interested in stirring up controversy that might cost them an election.  But that makes it all the more important that we’ve got folks like you who believe in practicing politics at its best.   

So when you talk to principled, passionate people who want to run for office for the right reasons but wonder if it’s really worth it, you can tell them that the President of the United States says absolutely.  It is absolutely worth it.  We haven’t won every fight.  We’ve got a lot more work to do.  But all across America, there are people who have jobs today that didn’t have them because of the work that we did.  There are people who have health insurance today who didn’t have it before because of the work that we did.  There are students who are going to college for the first time because we’ve made that possible.  There are veterans who served tour after tour who are now home with their families and are getting help that they have not only earned but that will help make our country stronger.   

So that’s what change looks like.  And that’s why the right policies are important.  And that’s what public service is about.  So I want to thank all of you for the outstanding work that you are doing to keep your communities, your states on the right track.  When you get frustrated, don’t lose heart, because we’re counting on you and, more importantly, the families in your districts and in your states are counting on you.  And I think their faith is well-placed.

Thank you very much, everybody.  (Applause.) 

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, heads of state and government.  Last year, here at the United Nations, I called on the world to unite against the evil that is ISIL, or Daesh, and to eradicate the scourge of violent extremism.  And I challenged countries to return to the General Assembly this year with concrete steps that we can take together.  

I want to thank everyone who is here today, including my fellow leaders, for answering this call.  We are joined by representatives from more than 100 nations, more than 20 multilateral institutions, some 120 civil society groups from around the world, and partners from the private sector.  I believe what we have here today is the emergence of a global movement that is united by the mission of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.  

Together, we’re pursuing a comprehensive strategy that is informed by our success over many years in crippling the al Qaeda core in the tribal regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  And we are harnessing all of our tools -- military, intelligence, economic, development and the strength of our communities.  

Now, I have repeatedly said that our approach will take time.  This is not an easy task.  We have ISIL taking root in areas that already are suffering from failed governance, in some cases; in some cases, civil war or sectarian strife.  And as a consequence of the vacuum that exists in many of these areas, ISIL has been able to dig in.  They have shown themselves to be resilient, and they are very effective through social media and have been able to attract adherents not just from the areas in which they operate, but in many of our own countries.

There are going to be successes and there are going to be setbacks.  This is not a conventional battle.  This is a long-term campaign -- not only against this particular network, but against its ideology.  And so with the few minutes I have, I want to provide a brief overview of where we stand currently.

Our coalition has grown to some 60 nations, including our Arab partners.  Together, we welcome three new countries to our coalition -- Nigeria, Tunisia and Malaysia.  Nearly two dozen nations are in some way contributing to the military campaign, and we salute and are grateful for all the servicemembers from our respective nations who are performing with skill and determination.

In Iraq, ISIL continues to hold Mosul, Fallujah and Ramadi.  But Iraqi forces, backed by coalition air power, have liberated towns across Kirkuk province and Tikrit.  ISIL has now lost nearly a third of the populated areas in Iraq that it had controlled.  Eighteen countries are now helping to train and support Iraqi forces, including Sunni volunteers who want to push ISIL out of their communities.  And, Prime Minister Abadi, I want to note the enormous sacrifices being made by Iraqi forces and the Iraqi people in this fight every day.  

In Syria, which has obviously been a topic of significant discussion during the course of this General Assembly, we have seen support from Turkey that has allowed us to intensify our air campaign there.  ISIL has been pushed back from large sections of northeastern Syria, including the key city of Tal Abyad, putting new pressure on its stronghold of Raqqa.  And ISIL has been cut off from almost the entire region bordering Turkey, which is a critical step toward stemming the flow of foreign terrorist fighters. 

Following the special Security Council meeting I chaired last year, more than 20 additional countries have passed or strengthened laws to disrupt the flow of foreign terrorist fighters.  We share more information and we are strengthening border controls.  We’ve prevented would-be fighters from reaching the battlefield and returning to threaten our countries.  But this remains a very difficult challenge, and today we’re going to focus on how we can do more together.  In conjunction with this summit, the United States and our partners are also taking new steps to crack down on the illicit finance that ISIL uses to pay its fighters, fund its operations and launch attacks.

Our military and intelligence efforts are not going to succeed alone; they have to be matched by political and economic progress to address the conditions that ISIL has exploited in order to take root.  Prime Minister Abadi is taking important steps to build a more inclusive and accountable government, while working to stabilize areas taken back from ISIL.  And our nations need to help Prime Minister Abadi in these efforts.

In Syria, as I said yesterday, defeating ISIL requires -- I believe -- a new leader and an inclusive government that unites the Syrian people in the fight against terrorist groups.  This is going to be a complex process.  And as I’ve said before, we are prepared to work with all countries, including Russia and Iran, to find a political mechanism in which it is possible to begin a transition process.

As ISIL’s tentacles reach into other regions, the United States is increasing our counterterrorism cooperation with partners, like Tunisia.  We’re boosting our support to Nigeria and its neighbors as they push back against Boko Haram, which has pledged allegiance to ISIL.  And we’re creating a new clearinghouse to better coordinate the world’s support for countries’ counterterrorism programs so that our efforts are as effective as possible. 

Ultimately, however, it is not going to be enough to defeat ISIL in the battlefield.  We have to prevent it from radicalizing, recruiting and inspiring others to violence in the first place.  And this means defeating their ideology.  Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they’re defeated by better ideas -- a more attractive and compelling vision.  Building on our White House summit earlier this year, and summits around the world since then, we’re moving ahead, together, in several areas.  

We’re stepping up our efforts to discredit ISIL’s propaganda, especially online.  The UAE’s new messaging hub -- the Sawab Center -- is exposing ISIL for what it is, which is a band of terrorists that kills innocent Muslim men, women and children.  We’re working to lift up the voices of Muslim scholars, clerics and others -- including ISIL defectors -- who courageously stand up to ISIL and its warped interpretations of Islam.

We recognize that we have to confront the economic grievances that exist in some of the areas that ISIL seeks to exploit.  Poverty does not cause terrorism.  But as we’ve seen across the Middle East and North Africa, when people, especially young people, are impoverished and hopeless and feel humiliated by injustice and corruption, that can fuel resentments that terrorists exploit.  Which is why sustainable development -- creating opportunity and dignity, particularly for youth -- is part of countering violent extremism.

We recognize we also have to address the political grievances that ISIL exploits.  I’ve said this before -- when human rights are denied and citizens have no opportunity to redress their grievances peacefully, it feeds terrorist propaganda that justifies violence.  Likewise, when political opponents are treated like terrorists and thrown in jail, it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  So the real path to lasting stability and progress is not less democracy; I believe it is more democracy in terms of free speech, and freedom of religion, rule of law, strong civil societies.  All that has to play a part in countering violent extremism.  

And finally, we recognize that our best partners in protecting vulnerable people from succumbing to violent extremist ideologies are the communities themselves -- families, friends, neighbors, clerics, faith leaders who love and care for these young people.

Remember that violent extremism is not unique to any one faith, so no one should be profiled or targeted simply because of their faith.  Yet we have to recognize that ISIL is targeting Muslim communities around the world, especially individuals who may be disillusioned or confused or wrestling with their identities.  

And in all our countries, we have to continue to build true partnerships with Muslim communities, based on trust and cooperation, so that they can help protect their loved ones from becoming radicalized.  This cannot just be the work of government.  It is up to all of us.  We have to commit ourselves to build diverse, tolerant, inclusive societies that reject anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant bigotry that creates the divisions, the fear and the resentments upon which extremists can prey.  

I’m pleased that here at this summit, businesses -- including high-tech companies -- are investing funds, training and technological expertise to support innovative programs that push back on violent extremism.  Cities around the world are joining together to build more resilient communities.  Researchers are partnering to share best practices, knowing what works and what we can do better.  

And as we saw yesterday, young people from around the world are participating in their own summit.  These young people, many of them Muslim, are coming together and using their talents and technology to push back on ISIL’s propaganda, especially online, and to protect their brothers and sisters from recruitment.  These young people are an inspiration and give us hope, and I’d ask everyone to join me in thanking all the young people who are here today.  (Applause.)    

So, to conclude, we face a grave challenge.  We have to be clear-eyed about the fact that this is very hard work.  We have individuals here, like Prime Minister Abadi and President Buhari, who are on the front lines.  And this is not going to be turned around overnight, because it is not just a military campaign that we are involved in.  There are profound changes taking place in the Middle East and North Africa.  There are problems that have built over decades that are expressing themselves and manifesting themselves in organizations like ISIL.  Even if we were to wipe out the entire cadre of ISIL leadership, we would still have some of these forces at work.

But, ultimately, I am optimistic.  In Iraq and in Syria, ISIL is surrounded by communities, countries and a broad international coalition committed to its destruction.  We’ve seen that ISIL can be defeated on the battlefield, where there is sound organization and a government and military that is coordinating with this coalition and with our diplomatic efforts.  And here at this summit, we’re seeing a new global movement to counter the violent extremism that ISIL needs to survive.  

Like terrorists and tyrants throughout history, ISIL will eventually lose because it has nothing to offer but suffering and death.  And when you look at the reports of those who are laboring under their control, it is a stark and brutal life that does not appeal to people over the long term.  So we will ultimately prevail because we are guided by a stronger, better vision:  a commitment to the security, opportunity and dignity of every human being.  But it will require diligence, focus and sustained effort by all of us.  And I am grateful that all of you who are already participating are committed to this work.

With that, I want to give the floor to our Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon.  (Applause.)

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen:  Seventy years after the founding of the United Nations, it is worth reflecting on what, together, the members of this body have helped to achieve.  

Out of the ashes of the Second World War, having witnessed the unthinkable power of the atomic age, the United States has worked with many nations in this Assembly to prevent a third world war -- by forging alliances with old adversaries; by supporting the steady emergence of strong democracies accountable to their people instead of any foreign power; and by building an international system that imposes a cost on those who choose conflict over cooperation, an order that recognizes the dignity and equal worth of all people.  

That is the work of seven decades.  That is the ideal that this body, at its best, has pursued.  Of course, there have been too many times when, collectively, we have fallen short of these ideals.  Over seven decades, terrible conflicts have claimed untold victims.  But we have pressed forward, slowly, steadily, to make a system of international rules and norms that are better and stronger and more consistent. 

It is this international order that has underwritten unparalleled advances in human liberty and prosperity.  It is this collective endeavor that’s brought about diplomatic cooperation between the world’s major powers, and buttressed a global economy that has lifted more than a billion people from poverty.  It is these international principles that helped constrain bigger countries from imposing our will on smaller ones, and advanced the emergence of democracy and development and individual liberty on every continent. 

This progress is real.  It can be documented in lives saved, and agreements forged, and diseases conquered, and in mouths fed. And yet, we come together today knowing that the march of human progress never travels in a straight line, that our work is far from complete; that dangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world.  

Today, we see the collapse of strongmen and fragile states breeding conflict, and driving innocent men, women and children across borders on an *epoch epic scale.  Brutal networks of terror have stepped into the vacuum.  Technologies that empower individuals are now also exploited by those who spread disinformation, or suppress dissent, or radicalize our youth.  Global capital flows have powered growth and investment, but also increased risk of contagion, weakened the bargaining power of workers, and accelerated inequality.  

How should we respond to these trends?  There are those who argue that the ideals enshrined in the U.N. charter are unachievable or out of date -- a legacy of a postwar era not suited to our own.  Effectively, they argue for a return to the rules that applied for most of human history and that pre-date this institution: the belief that power is a zero-sum game; that might makes right; that strong states must impose their will on weaker ones; that the rights of individuals don’t matter; and that in a time of rapid change, order must be imposed by force. 

On this basis, we see some major powers assert themselves in ways that contravene international law.  We see an erosion of the democratic principles and human rights that are fundamental to this institution’s mission; information is strictly controlled, the space for civil society restricted.  We’re told that such retrenchment is required to beat back disorder; that it’s the only way to stamp out terrorism, or prevent foreign meddling.  In accordance with this logic, we should support tyrants like Bashar al-Assad, who drops barrel bombs to massacre innocent children, because the alternative is surely worse. 

The increasing skepticism of our international order can also be found in the most advanced democracies.  We see greater polarization, more frequent gridlock; movements on the far right, and sometimes the left, that insist on stopping the trade that binds our fates to other nations, calling for the building of walls to keep out immigrants.  Most ominously, we see the fears of ordinary people being exploited through appeals to sectarianism, or tribalism, or racism, or anti-Semitism; appeals to a glorious past before the body politic was infected by those who look different, or worship God differently; a politics of us versus them. 

The United States is not immune from this.  Even as our economy is growing and our troops have largely returned from Iraq and Afghanistan, we see in our debates about America’s role in the world a notion of strength that is defined by opposition to old enemies, perceived adversaries, a rising China, or a resurgent Russia; a revolutionary Iran, or an Islam that is incompatible with peace.  We see an argument made that the only strength that matters for the United States is bellicose words and shows of military force; that cooperation and diplomacy will not work.  

As President of the United States, I am mindful of the dangers that we face; they cross my desk every morning.  I lead the strongest military that the world has ever known, and I will never hesitate to protect my country or our allies, unilaterally and by force where necessary. 

But I stand before you today believing in my core that we, the nations of the world, cannot return to the old ways of conflict and coercion.  We cannot look backwards.  We live in an integrated world -- one in which we all have a stake in each other’s success.  We cannot turn those forces of integration.  No nation in this Assembly can insulate itself from the threat of terrorism, or the risk of financial contagion; the flow of migrants, or the danger of a warming planet.  The disorder we see is not driven solely by competition between nations or any single ideology.  And if we cannot work together more effectively, we will all suffer the consequences.  That is true for the United States, as well.   

No matter how powerful our military, how strong our economy, we understand the United States cannot solve the world’s problems alone.  In Iraq, the United States learned the hard lesson that even hundreds of thousands of brave, effective troops, trillions of dollars from our Treasury, cannot by itself impose stability on a foreign land.  Unless we work with other nations under the mantle of international norms and principles and law that offer legitimacy to our efforts, we will not succeed.  And unless we work together to defeat the ideas that drive different communities in a country like Iraq into conflict, any order that our militaries can impose will be temporary.  

Just as force alone cannot impose order internationally, I believe in my core that repression cannot forge the social cohesion for nations to succeed.  The history of the last two decades proves that in today’s world, dictatorships are unstable. The strongmen of today become the spark of revolution tomorrow.  You can jail your opponents, but you can’t imprison ideas.  You can try to control access to information, but you cannot turn a lie into truth.  It is not a conspiracy of U.S.-backed NGOs that expose corruption and raise the expectations of people around the globe; it’s technology, social media, and the irreducible desire of people everywhere to make their own choices about how they are governed.  

Indeed, I believe that in today’s world, the measure of strength is no longer defined by the control of territory.   Lasting prosperity does not come solely from the ability to access and extract raw materials.  The strength of nations depends on the success of their people -- their knowledge, their innovation, their imagination, their creativity, their drive, their opportunity -- and that, in turn, depends upon individual rights and good governance and personal security.  Internal repression and foreign aggression are both symptoms of the failure to provide this foundation.  

A politics and solidarity that depend on demonizing others, that draws on religious sectarianism or narrow tribalism or jingoism may at times look like strength in the moment, but over time its weakness will be exposed.  And history tells us that the dark forces unleashed by this type of politics surely makes all of us less secure.  Our world has been there before.  We gain nothing from going back. 

Instead, I believe that we must go forward in pursuit of our ideals, not abandon them at this critical time.  We must give expression to our best hopes, not our deepest fears.  This institution was founded because men and women who came before us had the foresight to know that our nations are more secure when we uphold basic laws and basic norms, and pursue a path of cooperation over conflict.  And strong nations, above all, have a responsibility to uphold this international order. 

Let me give you a concrete example.  After I took office, I made clear that one of the principal achievements of this body -- the nuclear non-proliferation regime -- was endangered by Iran’s violation of the NPT.  On that basis, the Security Council tightened sanctions on the Iranian government, and many nations joined us to enforce them.  Together, we showed that laws and agreements mean something. 

But we also understood that the goal of sanctions was not simply to punish Iran.  Our objective was to test whether Iran could change course, accept constraints, and allow the world to verify that its nuclear program will be peaceful.  For two years, the United States and our partners -- including Russia, including China -- stuck together in complex negotiations.  The result is a lasting, comprehensive deal that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, while allowing it to access peaceful energy.  And if this deal is fully implemented, the prohibition on nuclear weapons is strengthened, a potential war is averted, our world is safer.  That is the strength of the international system when it works the way it should. 

That same fidelity to international order guides our responses to other challenges around the world.  Consider Russia’s annexation of Crimea and further aggression in eastern Ukraine.  America has few economic interests in Ukraine.  We recognize the deep and complex history between Russia and Ukraine.  But we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is flagrantly violated.  If that happens without consequence in Ukraine, it could happen to any nation gathered here today.  That’s the basis of the sanctions that the United States and our partners impose on Russia.  It's not a desire to return to a Cold War. 

Now, within Russia, state-controlled media may describe these events as an example of a resurgent Russia -- a view shared, by the way, by a number of U.S. politicians and commentators who have always been deeply skeptical of Russia, and seem to be convinced a new Cold War is, in fact, upon us.  And yet, look at the results.  The Ukrainian people are more interested than ever in aligning with Europe instead of Russia. Sanctions have led to capital flight, a contracting economy, a fallen ruble, and the emigration of more educated Russians.  

Imagine if, instead, Russia had engaged in true diplomacy, and worked with Ukraine and the international community to ensure its interests were protected.  That would be better for Ukraine, but also better for Russia, and better for the world -- which is why we continue to press for this crisis to be resolved in a way that allows a sovereign and democratic Ukraine to determine its future and control its territory.  Not because we want to isolate Russia -- we don't -- but because we want a strong Russia that’s invested in working with us to strengthen the international system as a whole.  

Similarly, in the South China Sea, the United States makes no claim on territory there.  We don't adjudicate claims.  But like every nation gathered here, we have an interest in upholding the basic principles of freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce, and in resolving disputes through international law, not the law of force.  So we will defend these principles, while encouraging China and other claimants to resolve their differences peacefully. 

I say this, recognizing that diplomacy is hard; that the outcomes are sometimes unsatisfying; that it's rarely politically popular.  But I believe that leaders of large nations, in particular, have an obligation to take these risks -- precisely because we are strong enough to protect our interests if, and when, diplomacy fails.  

I also believe that to move forward in this new era, we have to be strong enough to acknowledge when what you’re doing is not working.  For 50 years, the United States pursued a Cuba policy that failed to improve the lives of the Cuban people.  We changed that.  We continue to have differences with the Cuban government. We will continue to stand up for human rights.  But we address these issues through diplomatic relations, and increased commerce, and people-to-people ties.  As these contacts yield progress, I’m confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that should not be in place anymore.  (Applause.)  Change won’t come overnight to Cuba, but I’m confident that openness, not coercion, will support the reforms and better the life the Cuban people deserve, just as I believe that Cuba will find its success if it pursues cooperation with other nations. 

Now, if it’s in the interest of major powers to uphold international standards, it is even more true for the rest of the community of nations.  Look around the world.  From Singapore to Colombia to Senegal, the facts shows that nations succeed when they pursue an inclusive peace and prosperity within their borders, and work cooperatively with countries beyond their borders.  

That path is now available to a nation like Iran, which, as of this moment, continues to deploy violent proxies to advance its interests.  These efforts may appear to give Iran leverage in disputes with neighbors, but they fuel sectarian conflict that endangers the entire region, and isolates Iran from the promise of trade and commerce.  The Iranian people have a proud history, and are filled with extraordinary potential.  But chanting “Death to America” does not create jobs, or make Iran more secure.  If Iran chose a different path, that would be good for the security of the region, good for the Iranian people, and good for the world. 

Of course, around the globe, we will continue to be confronted with nations who reject these lessons of history, places where civil strife, border disputes, and sectarian wars bring about terrorist enclaves and humanitarian disasters.  Where order has completely broken down, we must act, but we will be stronger when we act together. 

In such efforts, the United States will always do our part. We will do so mindful of the lessons of the past -- not just the lessons of Iraq, but also the example of Libya, where we joined an international coalition under a U.N. mandate to prevent a slaughter.  Even as we helped the Libyan people bring an end to the reign of a tyrant, our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind.  We’re grateful to the United Nations for its efforts to forge a unity government.  We will help any legitimate Libyan government as it works to bring the country together.  But we also have to recognize that we must work more effectively in the future, as an international community, to build capacity for states that are in distress, before they collapse.  

And that’s why we should celebrate the fact that later today the United States will join with more than 50 countries to enlist new capabilities -- infantry, intelligence, helicopters, hospitals, and tens of thousands of troops -- to strengthen United Nations peacekeeping.  (Applause.)  These new capabilities can prevent mass killing, and ensure that peace agreements are more than words on paper.  But we have to do it together.  Together, we must strengthen our collective capacity to establish security where order has broken down, and to support those who seek a just and lasting peace. 

Nowhere is our commitment to international order more tested than in Syria.  When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a matter of one nation’s internal affairs -- it breeds human suffering on an order of magnitude that affects us all.  Likewise, when a terrorist group beheads captives, slaughters the innocent and enslaves women, that’s not a single nation’s national security problem -- that is an assault on all humanity. 

I’ve said before and I will repeat:  There is no room for accommodating an apocalyptic cult like ISIL, and the United States makes no apologies for using our military, as part of a broad coalition, to go after them.  We do so with a determination to ensure that there will never be a safe haven for terrorists who carry out these crimes.  And we have demonstrated over more than a decade of relentless pursuit of al Qaeda, we will not be outlasted by extremists.  

But while military power is necessary, it is not sufficient to resolve the situation in Syria.  Lasting stability can only take hold when the people of Syria forge an agreement to live together peacefully.  The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict. But we must recognize that there cannot be, after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, a return to the pre-war status quo.  

Let’s remember how this started.  Assad reacted to peaceful protests by escalating repression and killing that, in turn, created the environment for the current strife.  And so Assad and his allies cannot simply pacify the broad majority of a population who have been brutalized by chemical weapons and indiscriminate bombing.  Yes, realism dictates that compromise will be required to end the fighting and ultimately stamp out ISIL.  But realism also requires a managed transition away from Assad and to a new leader, and an inclusive government that recognizes there must be an end to this chaos so that the Syrian people can begin to rebuild.  

We know that ISIL -- which emerged out of the chaos of Iraq and Syria -- depends on perpetual war to survive.  But we also know that they gain adherents because of a poisonous ideology.  So part of our job, together, is to work to reject such extremism that infects too many of our young people.  Part of that effort must be a continued rejection by Muslims of those who distort Islam to preach intolerance and promote violence, and it must also a rejection by non-Muslims of the ignorance that equates Islam with terror.  (Applause.)    

This work will take time.  There are no easy answers to Syria.  And there are no simple answers to the changes that are taking place in much of the Middle East and North Africa.  But so many families need help right now; they don’t have time.  And that’s why the United States is increasing the number of refugees who we welcome within our borders.  That’s why we will continue to be the largest donor of assistance to support those refugees. And today we are launching new efforts to ensure that our people and our businesses, our universities and our NGOs can help as well -- because in the faces of suffering families, our nation of immigrants sees ourselves. 

Of course, in the old ways of thinking, the plight of the powerless, the plight of refugees, the plight of the marginalized did not matter.  They were on the periphery of the world’s concerns.  Today, our concern for them is driven not just by conscience, but should also be drive by self-interest.  For helping people who have been pushed to the margins of our world is not mere charity, it is a matter of collective security.  And the purpose of this institution is not merely to avoid conflict, it is to galvanize the collective action that makes life better on this planet. 

The commitments we’ve made to the Sustainable Development Goals speak to this truth.  I believe that capitalism has been the greatest creator of wealth and opportunity that the world has ever known.  But from big cities to rural villages around the world, we also know that prosperity is still cruelly out of reach for too many.  As His Holiness Pope Francis reminds us, we are stronger when we value the least among these, and see them as equal in dignity to ourselves and our sons and our daughters. 

We can roll back preventable disease and end the scourge of HIV/AIDS.  We can stamp out pandemics that recognize no borders. That work may not be on television right now, but as we demonstrated in reversing the spread of Ebola, it can save more lives than anything else we can do. 

Together, we can eradicate extreme poverty and erase barriers to opportunity.  But this requires a sustained commitment to our people -- so farmers can feed more people; so entrepreneurs can start a business without paying a bribe; so young people have the skills they need to succeed in this modern, knowledge-based economy. 

We can promote growth through trade that meets a higher standard.  And that’s what we’re doing through the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- a trade agreement that encompasses nearly 40 percent of the global economy; an agreement that will open markets, while protecting the rights of workers and protecting the environment that enables development to be sustained. 

We can roll back the pollution that we put in our skies, and help economies lift people out of poverty without condemning our children to the ravages of an ever-warming climate.  The same ingenuity that produced the Industrial Age and the Computer Age allows us to harness the potential of clean energy.  No country can escape the ravages of climate change.  And there is no stronger sign of leadership than putting future generations first.  The United States will work with every nation that is willing to do its part so that we can come together in Paris to decisively confront this challenge.  

And finally, our vision for the future of this Assembly, my belief in moving forward rather than backwards, requires us to defend the democratic principles that allow societies to succeed. Let me start from a simple premise:  Catastrophes, like what we are seeing in Syria, do not take place in countries where there is genuine democracy and respect for the universal values this institution is supposed to defend.  (Applause.)   

I recognize that democracy is going to take different forms in different parts of the world.  The very idea of a people governing themselves depends upon government giving expression to their unique culture, their unique history, their unique experiences.  But some universal truths are self-evident.  No person wants to be imprisoned for peaceful worship.  No woman should ever be abused with impunity, or a girl barred from going to school.  The freedom to peacefully petition those in power without fear of arbitrary laws -- these are not ideas of one country or one culture.  They are fundamental to human progress. They are a cornerstone of this institution.  

I realize that in many parts of the world there is a different view -- a belief that strong leadership must tolerate no dissent.  I hear it not only from America’s adversaries, but privately at least I also hear it from some of our friends.  I disagree.  I believe a government that suppresses peaceful dissent is not showing strength; it is showing weakness and it is showing fear.  (Applause.)  History shows that regimes who fear their own people will eventually crumble, but strong institutions built on the consent of the governed endure long after any one individual is gone.  

That's why our strongest leaders -- from George Washington to Nelson Mandela -- have elevated the importance of building strong, democratic institutions over a thirst for perpetual power.  Leaders who amend constitutions to stay in office only acknowledge that they failed to build a successful country for their people -- because none of us last forever.  It tells us that power is something they cling to for its own sake, rather than for the betterment of those they purport to serve. 

I understand democracy is frustrating.  Democracy in the United States is certainly imperfect.  At times, it can even be dysfunctional.  But democracy -- the constant struggle to extend rights to more of our people, to give more people a voice -- is what allowed us to become the most powerful nation in the world. (Applause.)  

It's not simply a matter of principle; it's not an abstraction.  Democracy -- inclusive democracy -- makes countries stronger.  When opposition parties can seek power peacefully through the ballot, a country draws upon new ideas.  When a free media can inform the public, corruption and abuse are exposed and can be rooted out.  When civil society thrives, communities can solve problems that governments cannot necessarily solve alone.  When immigrants are welcomed, countries are more productive and more vibrant.  When girls can go to school, and get a job, and pursue unlimited opportunity, that’s when a country realizes its full potential.  (Applause.)   

That is what I believe is America’s greatest strength.  Not everybody in America agrees with me.  That's part of democracy.  I believe that the fact that you can walk the streets of this city right now and pass churches and synagogues and temples and mosques, where people worship freely; the fact that our nation of immigrants mirrors the diversity of the world -- you can find everybody from everywhere here in New York City -- (applause) -- the fact that, in this country, everybody can contribute, everybody can participate no matter who they are, or what they look like, or who they love -- that's what makes us strong.  

And I believe that what is true for America is true for virtually all mature democracies.  And that is no accident.  We can be proud of our nations without defining ourselves in opposition to some other group.  We can be patriotic without demonizing someone else.  We can cherish our own identities -- our religion, our ethnicity, our traditions -- without putting others down.  Our systems are premised on the notion that absolute power will corrupt, but that people -- ordinary people  -- are fundamentally good; that they value family and friendship, faith and the dignity of hard work; and that with appropriate checks and balances, governments can reflect this goodness.  

I believe that’s the future we must seek together.  To believe in the dignity of every individual, to believe we can bridge our differences, and choose cooperation over conflict -- that is not weakness, that is strength.  (Applause.)  It is a practical necessity in this interconnected world. 

And our people understand this.  Think of the Liberian doctor who went door-to-door to search for Ebola cases, and to tell families what to do if they show symptoms.  Think of the Iranian shopkeeper who said, after the nuclear deal, “God willing, now we’ll be able to offer many more goods at better prices.”  Think of the Americans who lowered the flag over our embassy in Havana in 1961 -- the year I was born -- and returned this summer to raise that flag back up.  (Applause.)  One of these men said of the Cuban people, “We could do things for them, and they could do things for us.  We loved them.”  For 50 years, we ignored that fact.  

Think of the families leaving everything they’ve known behind, risking barren deserts and stormy waters just to find shelter; just to save their children.  One Syrian refugee who was greeted in Hamburg with warm greetings and shelter, said, “We feel there are still some people who love other people.” 

The people of our United Nations are not as different as they are told.  They can be made to fear; they can be taught to hate -- but they can also respond to hope.  History is littered with the failure of false prophets and fallen empires who believed that might always makes right, and that will continue to be the case.  You can count on that.  But we are called upon to offer a different type of leadership -- leadership strong enough to recognize that nations share common interests and people share a common humanity, and, yes, there are certain ideas and principles that are universal.

That's what those who shaped the United Nations 70 years ago understood.  Let us carry forward that faith into the future -- for it is the only way we can assure that future will be brighter for my children, and for yours.

Thank you very much.  (Applause.)
